# Writer’s Guide – Curse of Strahd Campaign Expansion

This guide defines how all Writer agents should structure and present the expanded Curse of Strahd campaign for an inexperienced Dungeon Master (DM). Follow this for consistency.

---

## 1. Audience and Purpose

1. The primary audience is a **brand-new, inexperienced DM** with weak improvisational and acting skills.
2. Every campaign file must be written so that the DM can **read it nearly verbatim** at the table and still deliver a compelling session.
3. All text must remain **faithful to Curse of Strahd lore and tone** while greatly expanding description, roleplay options, and guidance.

---

## 2. File Scope and Structure

1. Files are organized under `01-Campaign/`.
2. There should be **one markdown file per location, chapter, adventure, or clear adventure stage**. Long stages can be split into sequential parts.
3. Files are numbered in **chronological and level order**, using two-digit prefixes where possible, e.g.:
   - `01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House-Overview.md`
   - `02-Into-the-Mists-Scene-By-Scene.md`
   - `03-Death-House-Exterior.md`
   - `04-Death-House-Interior-Ground-Floor.md`
   - `05-Death-House-Interior-Upper-Floors-Part-1.md`
   - `06-Death-House-Interior-Upper-Floors-Part-2.md`
   - `07-Death-House-Basement-Part-1.md` (planned next), etc.
4. Each file must be **self-contained**: a DM should be able to open just that file and run that portion of the adventure.

---

## 3. Formatting Standards

1. Use Markdown with **clear, hierarchical headings** in numeric order:
   - `# 1. Main Section`
   - `## 1.1 Subsection`
   - `### 1.1.1 Sub-subsection`, etc.
2. Start each file with a short **orientation block** describing:
   - Where in the campaign this file fits.
   - What level range it targets.
   - What locations/major beats it covers.
3. Use blockquotes (`>`) for **DM read-aloud narration** and any dialogue that can be spoken verbatim.
4. Clearly label and separate:
   - **Narration** (for the DM to read).
   - **Acting Notes** (how to voice and portray NPCs).
   - **Mechanics** (checks, DCs, saving throws, combats, loot, triggers).
   - **Prompts** (questions to ask players, including silence prompts).

---

## 4. Required Content in Every Scene

For each significant scene, location, or beat, include the following where relevant:

1. **Narration**
   - Rich, sensory description using **all five senses** (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste when appropriate).
   - Keep paragraphs short and digestible; the DM will be reading them aloud.

2. **NPC Portrayal and Acting Notes**
   - How to voice each NPC (tone, pitch, accent hints, pacing).
   - Key mannerisms and posture.
   - Emotional baseline (e.g., fearful, arrogant, seductive, broken).

3. **NPC Dialogue**
   - Provide several **sample lines**, including:
     - Opening lines.
     - Likely answers to common questions.
     - Emotional outbursts or key phrases.
   - Dialogue should be elaborate but **easy to read aloud**.

4. **Player Interaction Prompts**
   - Frequently ask, **"What do you do?"** after descriptive beats.
   - Include both **open-ended prompts** (encouraging exploration and creativity) and **closed-ended prompts** (yes/no or specific options) to support a hesitant group.
   - Insert **Silence Prompts** where the DM is instructed to **say nothing for a few seconds**, allowing players to fill the space with roleplay.

5. **Likely Player Choices and DM Responses**
   - For each important moment, list 2–4 **likely player actions** with suggested DM reactions.
   - This helps the inexperienced DM handle common branches without freezing.

6. **Mechanical Elements**
   - **Skill Checks:** Always include the ability, skill, and **DC** (e.g. *Wisdom (Perception) DC 13*), with clear outcomes for success and failure.
   - **Saving Throws:** Specify the triggering event, DC, consequences on success and failure.
   - **Encounters:**
     - List all monsters with names, counts, and reference to their official stat blocks (Monster Manual, Curse of Strahd, etc.).
     - Briefly describe the **battlefield layout**: terrain, cover, hazards, verticality.
   - **Loot and Prices:**
     - Detail treasure, mundane items, and their approximate **gp values**.
     - Note Barovia’s **depressed economy** – most merchants buy at ~half value.

7. **Campaign Triggers and Conditions**
   - Explicitly note when events depend on things like:
     - **Tarokka results**.
     - Prior player choices.
     - Strahd’s level of interest.
   - Use a clear label like **Campaign Trigger:** so DMs can spot it quickly.

## 5. Tone, Lore, and Strahd

1. **Tone:**
   - Gothic horror, slow dread, psychological unease.
   - Violence and terror are present but should be **evocative, not gratuitous**.
   - Maintain a sense of **melancholy and tragedy**—Barovia is a prison of sorrow.

2. **Lore Fidelity:**
   - All major characters, locations, and events should remain **consistent with the published Curse of Strahd adventure**.
   - You may add detail, side NPCs, and optional encounters, but **do not contradict core facts** (Strahd’s nature, major plot beats, geography, etc.).

3. **Strahd’s Presence:**
   - Add **many optional and required Strahd interaction points**, such as:
     - Distant laughter, visions in mirrors, ravens reacting nervously.
     - Direct but brief appearances where he toys with the party.
   - These should be presented as **modular hooks**, clearly marked as optional so a DM can dial Strahd’s presence up or down.
   - Ensure every Strahd interaction is **aligned with his interests**:
     - Testing the party.
     - Studying potential champions.
     - Manipulating or punishing Barovians who defy him.

---

## 6. Optional Adventures and Re-Routing

1. Include **optional side adventures** or micro-encounters that:
   - Reinforce Barovia’s atmosphere.
   - Provide hooks to steer wandering players back toward the main plot.
2. Clearly label these as **Optional** and, when relevant, suggest when to use them:
   - To fill time.
   - To nudge players back toward a key location or NPC.

Example labeling:

> **Optional Side Scene – The Weeping Widow in the Alley**  
> Use this if the players drift away from the inn before speaking with [key NPC].

---

## 7. Leveling, Pacing, and Length

1. Assume characters will **start at low level** and progress through early Barovia (Death House, Village of Barovia, etc.).
2. Your expansions will be **much longer** than the source text—aim comfortably for 50–100x the original word count of a scene when fully elaborated.
3. Maintain **pacing awareness**:
   - Alternate between tension and brief relief.
   - Intermix combat, exploration, and roleplay.
   - Provide natural points where a session could end.

---

## 8. Role of Silence and Atmosphere

1. Regularly instruct the DM to **pause and be silent** after key descriptions.
2. These moments of silence are intentional tools to:
   - Let players absorb the horror.
   - Encourage them to speak first.
   - Create unease.

Example:

> **Silence Prompt:**  
> After reading this description, look at the players and say nothing for 5–10 seconds.

---

## 9. Interaction with Review Roles

1. The Writer creates and maintains:
   - The campaign files in `01-Campaign/`.
   - This `writtersguid.md` document.
   - The `writter.md` log.
   - The layout and status entries in `progress.md`.
2. Other roles (Master DM, Inexperienced DM, Player, Editor):
   - Read both **source material** and **written content**.
   - Provide **hard criticism** and **scores out of 10** in `agents/progress.md`.
   - Do **not** edit the campaign text files.
3. A section is complete only when:
   - The Writer marks it complete, and all roles score it **≥ 5**, with an overall average **≥ 7**.

---

## 10. Example Scene Pattern

When in doubt, follow this rough pattern for each major scene:

1. **Scene Overview** – 2–5 bullet points about where/when this happens.
2. **Read-Aloud Entrance Narration** – 1–3 paragraphs.
3. **Acting Notes for Key NPCs** – short but specific.
4. **Primary Interaction Options** – likely player actions and DM replies.
5. **Mechanical Details** – checks, DCs, encounters, loot.
6. **Strahd/Trigger Hooks** – how this scene might link to Strahd or the broader campaign.
7. **Exit/Transition Notes** – how to move cleanly into the next file or scene.

Writers should strive for **clarity, completeness, and ease of use at the table** above all.
