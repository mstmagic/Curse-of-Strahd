# Agent Progress and Reviews

## 01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House-Overview.md
- Writer Status: Draft
- Writer Notes: [object Object]
- Master Dungeon Master Score: 0/10
  - Notes: Not yet reviewed.
- Inexperienced Dungeon Master Score: 6/10
  - Notes: Structure is promising, but several instructions assume experience. Needs clearer, more linear procedure and more explicit read-aloud and "what do you do?" prompts. Some transitions between scenes are abrupt and could confuse a brand-new DM.

## 02-Into-the-Mists-Scene-By-Scene.md
- Writer Status: Draft
- Writer Notes: [object Object]
- Master Dungeon Master Score: 0/10
  - Notes: Not yet reviewed.
- Inexperienced Dungeon Master Score: 7/10
  - Notes: Very close to usable as a pin-by-pin script. Some sections still rely on DM improvisation (e.g., how to answer common rules questions, how to handle unexpected routes) and could use brief "If players do X, you do Y" bullet points. Silence prompts are present but could be more clearly marked so a nervous DM trusts them.

## 03-Death-House-Exterior.md
- Writer Status: Draft
- Writer Notes: [object Object]
- Master Dungeon Master Score: 0/10
  - Notes: Not yet reviewed.
- Inexperienced Dungeon Master Score: 8/10
  - Notes: Strong hand-holding and good use of numbered headers. NPC portrayal notes are clear. However, there is a lot of text per step; a new DM might struggle to find the next line quickly. Consider tighter labeling like "Read Aloud:" and "If players do this:" consistently, and possibly break some long paragraphs into smaller beats.

## 04-Death-House-Interior-Ground-Floor.md
- Writer Status: Draft
- Writer Notes: [object Object]
- Master Dungeon Master Score: 0/10
  - Notes: Not yet reviewed.
- Inexperienced Dungeon Master Score: 7/10
  - Notes: Content is rich and mostly step-by-step, but room-to-room flow could be clearer. A few conditional instructions (e.g., what if players skip a room, what if they split up) are under-specified. Add quick reference bullets for "When players enter this room…" and "When they leave this room…" to reduce decision paralysis.

## 05-Death-House-Interior-Upper-Floors-Part-1.md
- Writer Status: Draft
- Writer Notes: [object Object]
- Master Dungeon Master Score: 0/10
  - Notes: Not yet reviewed.
- Inexperienced Dungeon Master Score: 6/10
  - Notes: Very atmospheric, but the procedural clarity drops a bit compared to earlier files. Some NPC acting notes and likely player response sections are thinner or missing. For a brand-new DM, each notable object or NPC should come with an explicit "You say…" line and a short list of expected questions with answers.
