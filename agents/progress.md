## Sections

### 01 Into the Mists and Death House Overview
- Status: In Progress
- Writer Score: 7/10 - Solid foundation and structure. Could further expand certain sensory details and optional Strahd beats.
- Master Dungeon Master Score: 8/10 - Lore-consistent, good tone, strong onboarding for new DM. Recommend a few more explicit Strahd hooks and clearer callouts for optional content.
- Inexperienced Dungeon Master Score: 8/10 - Easy to follow, numbered headers work well. Some long paragraphs could be broken up more.
- Player Score: 7/10 - Feels atmospheric and intriguing, but could use a couple more early "hooks" for player agency.
- Editor Score: 8/10 - Conforms well to instructions and book tone; no major lore deviations detected.
- Notes: Not yet marked complete by Writer. Needs another revision pass once more early-game files are drafted.

### 02 Into the Mists Scene By Scene
- Status: In Progress
- Writer Score: 8/10 - Very detailed step-by-step scenes and prompts. Strong support for weak-actor DM.
- Master Dungeon Master Score: 9/10 - Captures Barovian dread and Strahd’s manipulative presence. Good balance between railroading and choice.
- Inexperienced Dungeon Master Score: 8/10 - Very usable at the table. Consider a couple of flowcharts or summary boxes later.
- Player Score: 8/10 - Many opportunities for interaction and tension. Should feel immersive.
- Editor Score: 9/10 - Accurately reflects source material entry into Barovia; formatting adheres to guide.
- Notes: Approaching completion once Death House sequence is fully in place.

### 03 Death House Exterior
- Status: In Progress
- Writer Score: 7/10 - Strong NPC portrayal of the children and mood-setting. Could push sensory detail of street and house further.
- Master Dungeon Master Score: 8/10 - Lore-faithful, appropriately sinister without giving too much away.
- Inexperienced Dungeon Master Score: 7/10 - Clear, but a few beats could use explicit "read this now" vs. "this is prep" labels.
- Player Score: 8/10 - The hook is compelling; children feel like a natural lure.
- Editor Score: 8/10 - Matches book’s structure; no major issues.
- Notes: Will reassess scores after Writer’s next revision pass and after interior sections are drafted.
