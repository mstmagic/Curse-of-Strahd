|-------------|-------------|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| 01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House-Overview.md | Campaign entry into Barovia, mists trapping, Death House overview | Writer: Marked complete | Score: 8/10 - Strong atmospheric overview and clear structure. Could use a couple of explicit "if players do X instead" sidebars per scene. | Score: 9/10 - Tone matches Curse of Strahd well, Strahd's presence feels appropriate but not overused. | Score: 7/10 - Good guidance but some paragraphs are long; add a few more explicit "Say this:" vs "Do this:" markers for brand-new DMs. | Score: 8/10 - Feels creepy and engaging; Death House hook is compelling. | Score: 8/10 - Generally matches lore; minor wording polish only. |
| 02-Into-the-Mists-Scene-By-Scene.md | Fully scripted step‑by‑step journey into the mists and to the village | Writer: Marked complete | Score: 9/10 - Very detailed, lots of prompts and branching. | Score: 9/10 - Lore and pacing are strong; Strahd touchpoints feel on-theme. | Score: 6/10 - Dense and intimidating at first glance. Needs clearer sub‑headers, maybe numbered steps per micro‑scene, and a short "Read this only" script for nervous DMs. | Score: 8/10 - Lots of opportunities to interact and roleplay; feels like a real journey. | Score: 8/10 - Accurate to book events; a few small spots could cross‑reference original page numbers more clearly. |
| 03-Death-House-Exterior.md | Outside approach, children hook, street atmosphere | Writer: Marked complete | Score: 9/10 - Excellent scene setting, strong child NPC voices. | Score: 9/10 - Fits Death House tone, Rose/Thorn characterization feels correct. | Score: 7/10 - Good use of bold "Read Aloud" but could benefit from a one‑paragraph "If players ignore the house" flow note. | Score: 8/10 - Feels spooky and intriguing; kids are memorable. | Score: 9/10 - Faithful to book details, with enriching but not conflicting additions. |
| 04-Death-House-Interior-Ground-Floor.md | First exploration inside Death House, ground floor rooms | Writer: Marked complete | Score: 9/10 - Room‑by‑room breakdown is strong, lots of player prompts and sensory details. | Score: 9/10 - Horror tone and pacing align with module; encounters and hazards track correctly. | Score: 6/10 - Still a bit text‑heavy for a brand‑new DM. Recommend adding quick‑reference bullet summaries at the start of each room, and highlighting key DCs/saves in a consistent style. | Score: 8/10 - Exploring feels tense and rewarding; good loot hooks and creepiness. | Score: 8/10 - Rules and lore consistent; layout and headings mostly follow the stated guide. |

Notes for Inexperienced DM Role (this file):
- Focus on readability: short paragraphs, bullet points, and clearly marked **Read Aloud** vs **DM Only**.
- Make saving throw information and DCs visually consistent (for example, bolding the DC and naming the ability).
- Provide clear "If the players do something unexpected" sidebars where confusion is likely.

As Inexperienced Dungeon Master, current overall impression: the written campaign is promising and flavorful but occasionally overwhelming for a first‑time DM. Iterative passes that carve out quick‑reference chunks will make it much more approachable at the table.
