# Campaign Progress Tracking

This file tracks the creation and review of the campaign materials. The Writer manages the structure. Each role (Writer, Master DM, Inexperienced DM, Player, Editor) updates **only** their own score and notes.

Scoring rules per section:
- Each role scores from **1–10** (10 = excellent).
- A section is **complete** when:
  - The Writer marks it complete, **and**
  - Each of the four reviewing roles scores **5 or more**, **and**
  - The average of all five scores is **7 or more**.
