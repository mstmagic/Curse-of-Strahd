## Completion Rules

A section is considered **Completed** when:
- The Writer marks the section as "Completed" in **Writer Status**, and
- Each role (Master DM, Inexperienced DM, Player, Editor) scores the section **5 or more**, and
- The **average** of all five scores is **7 or more**.

Each non-writer role should:
- Only edit their own **Score / Notes** column.
- Provide a numeric score out of 10.
- Add brief but honest critical notes.
