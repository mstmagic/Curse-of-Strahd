## Notes for Reviewers

- **Order of Review:** Please prioritize sections 1–4, as they cover the campaign’s entry into Barovia and the initial Death House experience.
- **Scoring Reminder:** A section is considered "complete" only when:
  - The writer has marked it complete, **and**
  - Each role has given a score of **5 or more**, **and**
  - The **average score is 7 or more**.
- **Critique Guidance:**
  - **Master Dungeon Master:** Focus on lore accuracy, pacing, horror tone, and replay value.
  - **Inexperienced Dungeon Master:** Flag anything confusing, intimidating, or under-explained.
  - **Player:** Judge how engaging, scary, and motivating each section feels from a player’s seat.
  - **Editor:** Ensure fidelity to the original *Curse of Strahd* text, rules correctness, and structural consistency with this GitHub project.
