- Master DM Score: 0/10 | Notes: [not yet reviewed by Master DM]
- Inexperienced DM Score: 7/10 | Notes: File is rich and flavorful but may overwhelm a brand new DM with its density. Consider adding even clearer "read this verbatim" callouts versus "DM guidance" so it's easier to track what to say in play. Structurally strong and in chronological order.
