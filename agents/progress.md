|-------------|--------|---------------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| 01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House-Overview.md | In Progress | 8 | Strong atmospheric start; may need even more concrete DM prompts later. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 02-Into-the-Mists-Scene-By-Scene.md | In Progress | 8 | Detailed scenes; might be overwhelming for very new DMs. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 03-Death-House-Exterior.md | In Progress | 9 | Clear exterior beats and Strahd hooks; check encounter balance. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 04-Death-House-Interior-Ground-Floor.md | In Progress | 9 | Lots of RP prompts; ensure rules notes are consistent with 5e. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 05-Death-House-Interior-Upper-Floors-Part-1.md | In Progress | 9 | Strong horror tone; may want a few more safety tool reminders. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 06-Death-House-Interior-Upper-Floors-Part-2.md | In Progress | 9 | NPC guidance is solid; double-check map references vs. source. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 07-Death-House-Attic-and-Nursery.md | In Progress | 9 | Very evocative; ensure ghost child mechanics are rules-accurate. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 08-Death-House-Basement-and-Ritual-Chamber-Part-1.md | In Progress | 9 | Good tension curve; might expand player choice branches. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 09-Death-House-Basement-and-Ritual-Chamber-Part-2.md | In Progress |  |  |  |  | 7 | Generally clear but some sequences still feel under-specified for a brand-new DM, especially how to transition between ritual phases and handle panicking players. Needs more explicit "read this" narration and a few more example call-and-response exchanges for edge cases. |  |  |  |  |
| 10-Post-Death-House-Aftermath-and-Transition-to-Barovia.md | In Progress |  |  |  |  | 7 | Emotional beats are promising but currently too skeletal for a novice. Needs more hand-holding on pacing the transition, suggesting rest/level-up moments, and giving concrete scripts for introducing Barovia proper. |  |  |  |  |
