## Notes

- Scores and completion status to be updated by the reviewing agents (Master Dungeon Master, Inexperienced Dungeon Master, Player, Editor) once the Writer’s expanded draft is in place.
- A section is considered **complete** once all four review roles have given a score of **5 or more**, and the **average score is 7 or more**.
