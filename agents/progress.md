# Campaign Writing Progress

Each section of the campaign will be tracked here.

Scoring system per role (0–10):
- 0–4: Needs major revision
- 5–6: Acceptable but needs improvement
- 7–8: Good, only minor issues
- 9–10: Excellent

A section is **Complete** when:
- Writer has marked it as complete, **and**
- All four reviewing roles (Master DM, Inexperienced DM, Player, Editor) have given scores **≥ 5**, **and**
- The **average** of the four review scores is **≥ 7**.

## Section: 01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House-Overview
- File: `01-Campaign/01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House-Overview.md`
- Status: In Review

**Writer Notes:**
High-level overview of the campaign start, the mists, and optional Death House. Focused on new DM support and tone-setting.

**Master DM Review:**
- Score: 8/10
- Notes: Lore alignment is solid and tone is suitably gothic. Could use a few more explicit ties to Strahd’s long-term schemes and Barovia’s broader politics to help DMs foreshadow later chapters.

**Inexperienced DM Review:**
- Score: 7/10
- Notes: Generally easy to follow, with good guidance. However, some paragraphs are quite dense. Consider breaking long blocks of text into numbered steps or bullet lists for at-the-table usability.

**Player Review:**
- Score: 7/10
- Notes: Feels atmospheric and interesting. Would benefit from 1–2 more concrete early hooks that give players a sense of agency before the mists close in.

**Editor Review:**
- Score: 8/10
- Notes: Conforms well to instructions and book tone. Watch for a few places where phrasing becomes slightly modern or jokey; keep the horror tone consistent.

## Section: 02-Into-the-Mists-Scene-By-Scene
- File: `01-Campaign/02-Into-the-Mists-Scene-By-Scene.md`
- Status: In Review

**Writer Notes:**
Step-by-step entry into Barovia via the mists, with heavy narration and scripted dialogue to support a weak actor DM.

**Master DM Review:**
- Score: 9/10
- Notes: Scene progression is clear and matches the book’s intent while expanding on mood. Consider adding 1–2 explicit contingency notes for parties that refuse to enter the mists.

**Inexperienced DM Review (You):**
- Score: 6/10
- Notes: The content is rich but sometimes overwhelming in volume. At the table, it may be hard for a new DM to find the next line to read. Recommend:
  - Stronger use of numbered headers for each micro-scene (2.1, 2.2, etc.).
  - Clearly labeled “Read This Aloud” vs. “DM Notes” blocks.
  - A short, one-paragraph recap at the top for quick reference during play.

**Player Review:**
- Score: 8/10
- Notes: The scripted interactions give lots of chances to roleplay and respond. Pacing improvements (less repeated description) would keep tension higher.

**Editor Review:**
- Score: 7/10
- Notes: Meets the instruction to be much more detailed than source text. A few internal references to monsters or DCs aren’t explicitly cross-checked against the book; verify those later.

## Section: 03-Death-House-Exterior
- File: `01-Campaign/03-Death-House-Exterior.md`
- Status: In Review

**Writer Notes:**
Covers the children outside Death House, the street, exterior description, and initial player approach, with roleplay support.

**Master DM Review:**
- Score: 8/10
- Notes: Nicely leans into the children’s uncanny nature and keeps to the module’s themes. Might benefit from 1–2 notes about how this hooks into Strahd’s broader interest in the characters.

**Inexperienced DM Review (You):
- Score: 6/10
- Notes:**
The material is atmospheric but could be streamlined for ease of use:
- Consider a short “At-a-Glance Flow” list at the top: (1) See children, (2) Children speak, (3) Players investigate, etc.
- Tag each chunk with clear labels like “NPC Voice – Rose” and “Likely Player Questions”.
- Include quick reference bullet points summarizing the key facts the children can reveal.

**Player Review:**
- Score: 7/10
- Notes: The eerie neighborhood and detailed kids’ dialogue are engaging. A couple more possible outcomes for players who try to ignore the house or kids would enhance agency.

**Editor Review:**
- Score: 7/10
- Notes: Generally in line with instructions and book content. Check formatting: a few headers might need renumbering to keep the numeric hierarchy consistent.

## Overall Inexperienced DM Comments So Far

Across the first three sections, the writing is flavorful and ambitious, but table usability for a brand-new DM can be improved by:

1. **Stronger structural signposting**
   - Number subheaders more aggressively (e.g., 2.1, 2.1.1, etc.).
   - Provide “Session Cheat Sheets” or short bullet recaps at the top of each file.

2. **Clear labeling of text types**
   - “Read Aloud” vs “DM Notes” vs “NPC Dialogue” should each have a consistent visual style.

3. **Practical prompts and branches**
   - Keep the excellent prompts, but group “Likely Player Actions & DM Responses” into short bullet lists to scan quickly.

4. **Reducing cognitive load**
   - Trim repetitive descriptive passages where possible or move them into optional “Extra Detail” callouts.

Once these usability adjustments are applied, these sections should be very approachable for a nervous, first-time DM.
