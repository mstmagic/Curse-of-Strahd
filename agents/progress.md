|---|---------|---------|--------|-------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | Into the Mists & Death House Overview | 01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House-Overview.md | In Progress | Initial draft complete. | 8/10 – Strong thematic alignment with Curse of Strahd; tone, lore, and Strahd’s presence feel appropriate. Could benefit from clearer mechanical call-outs in a few places. | 6/10 – Generally easy to follow, but some scenes layer multiple options and sidebars together in a way that might overwhelm a brand new DM. Recommend clearer, bolded step-by-step “do this, then this” structure and more explicit reminders of what to read aloud vs. what is DM-only guidance. | 8/10 – Very atmospheric and engaging; gives players plenty of roleplay hooks and mystery. Some scenes might run long; consider adding short “if the table stalls, jump to…” shortcuts. | 7/10 – Appears faithful to the source book’s intent and structure. Some added optional encounters may need explicit labels to avoid level/CR spikes. |
| 2 | Into the Mists – Scene by Scene | 02-Into-the-Mists-Scene-By-Scene.md | In Progress | Initial draft complete. | 8/10 – Scene order, tone, and lore feel right; good Strahd foreshadowing. Consider slightly tightening where multiple Strahd options are layered. | 7/10 – Scene numbering, headers, and prompts are helpful. A few dense paragraphs combine narration, rules, and options; suggest more bullet lists and boxed text markers to reduce cognitive load. | 8/10 – Lots of vivid sensory detail and interaction prompts. Potential for analysis paralysis if every option is used; might mark a recommended “default path” for new tables. | 8/10 – Rules and lore appear accurate for travel through the mists into Barovia. No obvious contradictions with published material. |
| 3 | Death House – Exterior | 03-Death-House-Exterior.md | In Progress | Initial draft complete. | 9/10 – Atmosphere, kids, and house presentation are strongly in keeping with Death House. Strahd hooks and Barovian tone are excellent. | 7/10 – Clearer labeling of DM-only guidance vs. read-aloud text would help, especially around the children’s lies and truths. Overall, relatively easy to run once that’s clarified. | 9/10 – Very compelling and creepy; strong hooks to enter the house. Player reactions likely to be intense and memorable. | 8/10 – Well aligned to the book’s depiction of the Durst family and Death House setup. Minor naming/continuity checks recommended in a future pass. |
| 4 | Death House – Interior Ground Floor | 04-Death-House-Interior-Ground-Floor.md | In Progress | Initial draft complete. | 8/10 – Room-by-room content and atmosphere feel right. Some mechanical notes (traps, checks) could be pulled into clearer bullet points. | 7/10 – For a new DM, this floor is mostly manageable, but the combination of lore, traps, and roleplay in certain rooms might become confusing; recommend adding quick-reference “At the Table” summaries for each room. | 8/10 – Exploration opportunities and tension are strong; players are likely to feel wary but curious. | 8/10 – Appears to follow the book’s layout and encounter structure with appropriate elaboration. |
| 5 | Death House – Interior Upper Floors Part 1 | 05-Death-House-Interior-Upper-Floors-Part-1.md | In Progress | Initial draft complete. | 8/10 – The horror escalates appropriately and matches the book’s intended tone. Good use of Durst backstory. | 6/10 – The vertical movement and multiple rooms can be tricky; suggest map references and clearer transition text (“Now read section X if they go up the stairs,” etc.). | 8/10 – The creep factor is high and there are strong roleplay and investigation beats. | 8/10 – Consistent with the published Death House structure. No major lore or rules deviations noticed. |

## Notes
- This table will be updated as more sections are written and reviewed.
- A section is considered complete once:
  - The writer confirms it is complete, AND
  - Each role provides a score of 5 or more, AND
  - The average score is 7 or more.
- Future reviewers should add new rows for new sections and update scores/notes as appropriate.
