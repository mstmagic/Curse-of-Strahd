## Notes by Role

### Writer General Notes

- Death House structure established as a sequence of highly-scripted, map-pin-ready files for inexperienced DMs.
- Tone kept faithful to *Curse of Strahd*: oppressive, tragic, and gothic horror with strong focus on Strahd as a distant, watching presence.
- Further basement material (cells, cult quarters, ritual chamber, shambling mound) to be added in `08-Death-House-Basement-and-Ritual-Chamber-Part-2.md` and subsequent files.

### Master Dungeon Master Notes

- Use this space for overall campaign-structure comments once several sections are reviewed.

### Inexperienced Dungeon Master Notes

- Please highlight any places where instructions are unclear or where more explicit step-by-step guidance is needed.

### Player Notes

- Focus feedback on whether scenes feel engaging, give you meaningful choices, and make Barovia feel alive.

### Editor Notes

- Track any inconsistencies with the Curse of Strahd source material or this repository’s style guide (`agents/writtersguid.md`).
