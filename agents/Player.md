# Player Review Log

## Role
Player

## Purpose
Review the written campaign pages to ensure the adventure appears fun, engaging, and exciting to *play*, not just to run.

I will:
- Focus on how enjoyable, immersive, and dynamic the campaign feels from a player’s perspective.
- Highlight sections that feel slow, confusing, or railroady.
- Praise sections that encourage meaningful choices, exploration, and roleplay.
- Suggest more hooks, mysteries, character tie-ins, or rewards where needed.

All critiques will be logged below with clear references to specific sections/filenames.
