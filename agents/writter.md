### Objective
Begin expanding the step-by-step campaign guide for Curse of Strahd, focusing on the Into the Mists opening and the optional Death House, tailored for an inexperienced DM with full narration and dialog.

### Actions Taken
1. Reviewed existing source material: "Curse of Strahd Book-02-Chapter 1 Into the Mists.md" and "Curse of Strahd Book-19-Apendix B Death House.md" to ensure lore accuracy.
2. Reviewed existing campaign file: "01-Campaign/01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House.md" to understand current structure and tone.
3. Planned restructuring of the opening file into numbered sections with explicit narration, acting notes, NPC guidance, likely player responses, encounters, and Strahd interaction hooks.
4. Prepared to overwrite and greatly expand the first campaign file to exceed the source text by at least two orders of magnitude, while preserving lore.

### Next Steps
- Fully rewrite and expand `01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House.md` with detailed DM-facing scripting, including the mists entrapment sequence and the entire Death House experience.
- Update `agents/progress.md` with a new entry for this section and mark its initial draft status.
