# Writer Log

## Session 1 – Initial Campaign Framework
- Reviewed project structure and existing agents files.
- Read `writtersguid.md` to align with style and structural expectations.
- Skimmed initial Curse of Strahd markdown source to refresh lore and tone.
- Created campaign files and outlined the early sequence:
  - `01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House-Overview.md`
  - `02-Into-the-Mists-Scene-By-Scene.md`
  - `03-Death-House-Exterior.md`
  - `04-Death-House-Interior-Ground-Floor.md`
  - `05-Death-House-Interior-Upper-Floors-Part-1.md`
- Focused on: highly guided narration, explicit DM prompts, NPC acting notes, and player‑choice branches.

## Session 2 – Death House Upper Floors, Part 2
- Re‑read relevant Death House attic sections from the source markdown to ensure lore alignment.
- Planned structure for continuing the upper floors and leading cleanly into the basement.
- Wrote `06-Death-House-Interior-Upper-Floors-Part-2.md`, covering:
  - Return to the third floor and discovery of the attic secret door.
  - Attic stair and landing atmosphere, exploration of storage rooms.
  - The children’s room with Rose and Thorn: full dialogue, acting notes, and roleplay hooks.
  - Investigation of the dollhouse as a map and discovery of the real secret passage.
  - Discovery of the children’s remains and optional possession scene.
  - Preparation to descend into the basement, with optional Strahd‑flavored visions/whispers.
- Emphasized:
  - Step‑by‑step narration and clear prompts for a very inexperienced DM.
  - Multiple likely player responses with suggested DM replies.
  - Optional Strahd interaction hooks that stay lore‑appropriate.

Next planned work:
- Begin `07-Death-House-Basement-Part-1.md`, starting from the top of the hidden stair and the first areas of the cult’s domain.
