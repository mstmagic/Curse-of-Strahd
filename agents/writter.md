## Session 1 – Into the Mists & Death House (Revision)

- Reviewed existing campaign files:
  - `01-Campaign/01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House.md`
  - `01-Campaign/02-Village-of-Barovia-and-First-Night.md`
- Confirmed overall structure matches the requested chronological, level-based progression.
- Began expanding and revising Chapter 1 (“Into the Mists & Death House”) to increase hand-holding for a brand new DM:
  - More explicit DM stage directions and acting notes.
  - Clearer branching prompts and likely player responses.
  - Additional Strahd touchpoints and foreshadowing.
  - Added silence cues and roleplay pauses.

Next: Deep expansion pass on `01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House.md` for even more verbatim narration, NPC guidance, and encounter clarity, then log changes and update `agents/progress.md` section status.
