# Writer Log

## Session 1 – Expansion of Campaign Files

- Reviewed existing campaign files in `/01-Campaign`.
- Confirmed scope: highly scripted, narrative-heavy Curse of Strahd campaign for a brand-new, weak-actor DM.
- Read source chapters:
  - *Curse of Strahd Book-01-ToC & Intro*
  - *Curse of Strahd Book-02-Chapter 1 Into the Mists*
  - *Curse of Strahd Book-03-Chapter 2 The Lands of Barovia*
  - *Curse of Strahd Book-04-Chapter 3 The Village of Barovia*
  - *Curse of Strahd Book-19-Appendix B Death House*

### Work Completed
- Skimmed existing writer-created files to ensure continuity with tone, structure, and level progression:
  - `01-Campaign/01-Mists-Arrival-and-Death-House-Prelude.md`
  - `01-Campaign/01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House.md`
  - `01-Campaign/02-Village-of-Barovia-and-First-Night.md`
- Began planning for next chronological section: early Village of Barovia onward, aligning with Chapter 3 and low-level progression.
- Prepared to create new, fully scripted files for:
  - **03 – Village of Barovia: Church, Burgomaster’s Mansion & Kolyan’s Funeral**
  - **04 – Road to Vallaki (with optional Strahd scenes and side treks)**

### Next Steps
- Draft `03-Village-of-Barovia-Church-Burgomaster-Funeral.md` with:
  - Scene-by-scene narration, dialogue, acting notes.
  - Player prompt trees and likely responses.
  - Strahd interaction options tied to Ireena, the church, and Kolyan’s funeral.
  - Combat encounter at the church (Doru) with clear tactics, battlefield layout, and safety valves for a new DM.
- Update `agents/progress.md` to log the new section once created.
