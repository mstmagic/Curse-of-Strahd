## Session 1 – Ground Floor Death House Interior
- **Date**: 2025-11-30
- **Work Completed**:
  - Reviewed existing campaign files in `01-Campaign`.
  - Reviewed writer guidelines and progress tracking documents.
  - Studied source material: *Curse of Strahd* Chapter 1 (Into the Mists) and Appendix B (Death House), focusing on the house’s ground floor.
  - Created `01-Campaign/04-Death-House-Interior-Ground-Floor.md` with a complete, word-for-word script for a new DM, including:
    - Boxed text narration for every room on the ground floor.
    - Acting and voice notes for portraying the house as a character.
    - Detailed likely player actions and DM responses.
    - Optional non-lethal horror beats and saving throws.
    - Loot lists with suggested Barovian prices.
    - Clear prompts, silence beats, and summary section for quick DM reference.
- **Next Planned Work**:
  - Write the **second-floor** interior script for Death House, continuing the same level of detail.
  - Begin adding early, optional Strahd observation beats tied to the house’s windows and mirrors.
