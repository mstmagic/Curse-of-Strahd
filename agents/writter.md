## Entry – Attic and Nursery Section

- Date: 2025-11-30
- Section: 07-Death-House-Attic-and-Nursery.md
- Summary of Work:
  - Added a fully scripted scene for the Death House attic and nursery, including:
    - Step-by-step narration for entering and exploring the attic.
    - Detailed roleplay guidance and dialog for Rose and Thorn.
    - Investigation of storage rooms and servants’ quarters with optional loot and lore.
    - Discovery and use of the dollhouse to locate the secret basement stairs.
    - Emotional hooks tying the party to the children’s fate.
    - Optional but rules-accurate handling of Rose/Thorn possession.
    - Subtle foreshadowing of Strahd’s awareness.
  - Ensured the writing assumes a brand-new DM who can read the text verbatim.
- Notes for Other Roles:
  - Check that tone and lore for Rose, Thorn, and Death House match the official Curse of Strahd appendix.
  - Confirm that the level of scripting and prompts is sufficient for an inexperienced, low-confidence DM.
  - Flag any places where more mechanical clarity (DCs, checks, rewards) would help.
