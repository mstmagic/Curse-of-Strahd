# Writer Log

## 2025-11-30
- Created initial `agents/writtersguid.md` writer's guide to standardize campaign expansion style and structure.
- Reviewed source material directory layout under `SourceMaterial/Curse of Stahd Book Markdown`.
- Next: create `agents/progress.md` and begin `01-Campaign` directory with early-level Barovia entry sequence (mists + Death House).
