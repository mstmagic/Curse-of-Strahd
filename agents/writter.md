# Writer Log

## Session 1 - Into the Mists & Death House Setup
- Reviewed `agents/writtersguid.md` to align tone, formatting, and process.
- Reviewed `agents/progress.md` to understand tracking and scoring workflow.
- Reviewed existing campaign files in `01-Campaign` (01–04) to maintain style and continuity.
- Reviewed source material chapters:
  - `Curse of Strahd Book-01-ToC & Intro.md`
  - `Curse of Strahd Book-02-Chapter 1 Into the Mists.md`
  - `Curse of Strahd Book-19-Apendix B Death House.md`
- Planned next written section: **05-Death-House-Interior-Upper-Floors-Part-1.md** (first half of upper floors, fully scripted for new DM).

## Session 2 - Writing Death House Upper Floors Part 1
- Created detailed step-by-step, fully scripted scenes for exploring the Death House first floor staircase, second floor hall, and key rooms.
- Included: narration, NPC acting notes, dialogue, likely player choices and DM responses, checks and saving throws, encounter structure, loot, and a few light Strahd-adjacent atmospheric beats.
- Maintained chronological and level-appropriate progression from existing files 01–04.

Next planned work: Complete the remainder of the upper floors (Part 2) and then the descent toward the basement, aligning with Death House appendix structure.
