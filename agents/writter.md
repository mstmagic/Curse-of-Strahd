# Writer Log

## Session 1 – Into the Mists & Death House (Planning)
- Reviewed existing file `01-Campaign/01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House.md`.
- Reviewed source material chapters:
  - `Curse of Strahd Book-01-ToC & Intro.md`
  - `Curse of Strahd Book-02-Chapter 1 Into the Mists.md`
  - `Curse of Strahd Book-19-Apendix B Death House.md`
- Goal: expand and refine a step‑by‑step, line‑readable script for an inexperienced DM, including narration, NPC direction, sample dialogues, likely player choices, and Strahd interaction hooks.
- Next: Begin outlining and then expanding Chapter 1 in `01-Campaign/01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House.md` and plan follow‑up chapter files for the Village of Barovia.
