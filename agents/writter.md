# Writer Log

## Session 2 – Extension Planning
- Reviewed existing campaign files `01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House.md` and `02-Village-of-Barovia-and-First-Night.md` to ensure continuity.
- Confirmed that the Curse of Strahd source markdown files are not yet present in `SourceMaterial/Curse of Stahd Book Markdown`, so lore alignment will rely on prior written material and rules-as-written knowledge.
- Planned additional Strahd interaction points, optional side treks, and stronger hand-holding for an inexperienced DM.
- Next actions this session:
  - Add at least one new early‑chapter file to `01-Campaign` in chronological, level‑appropriate order, focused on the Mists entry and lead‑in to Death House.
  - Update `agents/progress.md` with the new section entry.

## Completed This Session
- (In progress) Drafting `01-Mists-Arrival-and-Death-House-Prelude.md` with detailed narration, NPC direction, prompts, and contingency branches.
