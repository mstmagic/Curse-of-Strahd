Agent Log — Transcription Work

Date: 2025-11-28

Actions performed:

- Created directory placeholders (where absent) under SourceMaterial for each PDF set:
  - SourceMaterial/Curse of Strahd Book/
  - SourceMaterial/Curse of Strahd Handouts/
  - SourceMaterial/CurseofStrahdDM/
  - SourceMaterial/CurseofStrahdPG/

- Created initial README and first-chapter/handout placeholder Markdown files in each directory to begin transcription.

Files added or updated:

- SourceMaterial/Curse of Strahd Book/00_Readme.md
- SourceMaterial/Curse of Strahd Book/01_Chapter_01_Introduction.md
- SourceMaterial/Curse of Strahd Handouts/00_Readme.md
- SourceMaterial/Curse of Strahd Handouts/01_Handout_01.md
- SourceMaterial/CurseofStrahdDM/00_Readme.md
- SourceMaterial/CurseofStrahdDM/01_Chapter_01_DMNotes.md
- SourceMaterial/CurseofStrahdPG/00_Readme.md
- SourceMaterial/CurseofStrahdPG/01_Chapter_01_PlayerGuide.md

Next steps (planned):

1. Run OCR on each PDF and extract page ranges for chapterization.
2. Populate chapter files sequentially with cleaned and proofread Markdown text.
3. Add image assets (maps, handouts) into an images/ subfolder within each directory, referencing them in Markdown.
4. Iterate on formatting to match the original structure, and preserve DM-only content in DM directories only.

Notes and constraints:

- This commit creates placeholders and documents the transcription plan. Full transcription requires OCR and manual cleanup; those steps will be performed in subsequent commits.

Agent status: transcription scaffolding created; ready to proceed with OCR and detailed transcription.
