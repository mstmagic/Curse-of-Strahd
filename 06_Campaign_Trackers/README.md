# 06_Campaign_Trackers

Structured trackers to help a DM manage the evolving state of Barovia and the party’s journey through Curse of Strahd.

Planned trackers include:
- **Time & Weather Tracker**
- **Strahd’s Attention & Interest Tracker**
- **Village State Trackers** (Barovia, Vallaki, Krezk, etc.)
- **NPC Relationship Webs**
- **Tarokka Reading Outcomes & Prophecy Threads**
- **Party Corruption, Trauma, and Hope**

Each tracker will:
- Be formatted as markdown for easy printing or digital use.
- Provide guidance for when and how to update it.
- Include links back to relevant narration, encounters, and NPC dossiers.
