# 1. Mists Arrival – Roadside Encounters (Detailed)

> Cross-reference: **01_Narration_And_Dialog/01_Mists_And_Entry/01_00_Mists_Seize_the_Party.md** for narrative lead-in.

## 1.1 Design Goals

1. Provide **modular roadside encounters** to pace the journey from the mists to Barovia.  
2. Offer multiple **Strahd-touchpoints**: unseen, indirect, or brief appearances.  
3. Include **ret​raction hooks** that let you redirect wandering or split parties back toward the main path.
4. Ensure each encounter lists **creatures, terrain, initiative triggers, and likely player choices**.

## 2. Encounter: The Lost Carriage [Mini-Adventure – Retraction Hook #1]

### 2.1 Setup & Purpose
- **Use When:**
  - The party is lost in the mists or Old Svalich Road and you need to point them toward Barovia village.
  - You want to introduce Strahd’s heraldry and the feel of his domain without showing him directly.
- **Recommended Level:** 3–5 characters of level 3–4 (adjust as needed).

### 2.2 Terrain & Layout
- **Location:** A shallow depression beside the Old Svalich Road or a phantom stretch of road within the mists.
- **Features:**
  - Half-sunk black carriage, one wheel shattered, axle splintered.
  - Broken harness, traces of dried blood, no horses.
  - Roadside milestone: weathered, mostly illegible, faint carving of a raven.

**Battle Map Notes:**
- 40 ft x 40 ft clearing with the road cutting through the center.  
- Muddy ground counts as **difficult terrain** in a 10 ft radius around the carriage.  
- Two or three gnarled trees for cover (half cover, AC +2).

### 2.3 Encounter Flow

1. **Discovery:**  
   - Perception DC 10 at range 60 ft: see carriage silhouette in mist.  
   - Perception DC 13 at 30 ft: notice the crest (a stylized dragon over a mountain, or Strahd’s chosen heraldry).

2. **Approach:**  
   Ask: "Who approaches first, and how?" Then resolve checks as needed.

3. **Trigger:**
   - Once any PC inspects inside the carriage or touches the harness, the encounter begins.

### 2.4 Contents & Clues

- **Inside the Carriage:**
  - Torn velvet seats, rotted cushions.
  - A shattered, warped **wooden case** (once held a violin or other delicate item) – now empty.
  - A **sealed envelope** (DM can use this as a hook):
    - Possible contents: A forged or genuine letter from Strahd, an old invitation, a map fragment, or personal correspondence.
    - Cross-reference: **05_Lookup_Tables/Mists_Arrival_Lookups.md – Carriage Letter Contents Table**.

- **Under the Carriage:**
  - **Perception or Investigation DC 14** to find:
    - A crushed **silver holy symbol** of a forgotten deity, bent out of shape.  
    - Claw marks gouged into the wood from below.

### 2.5 Monsters & Hazard Options

Choose **one** of the following modes, depending on desired difficulty and tone.

#### 2.5.1 Mode A: Animated Harness Ambush (Low Combat, High Mood)

- **Creatures:**
  - 2–4 **Animated Harnesses** (reskinned **Animated Armor** but with lower HP).  
  - See **03_Monsters/000_Global_Monster_Index.md** for stats reference (create an entry **Animated Harness – Carriage Guardian**).

- **Trigger:**
  - When the letter is taken or the carriage is overturned, the tattered harness and bits of leather and metal animate, lashing out.

- **Tactics:**
  - Focus first on the character who took the letter or holy symbol.  
  - Use grapple/disarm flavored attacks (no extra mechanics needed beyond normal attacks; simply describe them as tangling reins and choking straps).

- **Strahd’s Touch:**
  - At 50% HP threshold for the last harness, have all motion halt for one round as a **cold, unseen presence** surveys the scene.
    - 
    > For a heartbeat, all motion seems to freeze. The mist holds its breath. You feel eyes on you—ancient, patient, weighing your worth.

  - Then the harness collapses; the encounter ends.

#### 2.5.2 Mode B: Corpse-Wagon of the Mists (Medium–Deadly, Horror)

- **Creatures:**
  - 1 **Wight** (the former courier)  
  - 2–4 **Zombies** or **Ghoul** variants spilling from beneath or within the carriage.

- **Lore Hook:**
  - The wight remembers *failing* Strahd and being condemned to forever ferry the dead (or to never reach his destination).

- **Roleplay:**
  - See **02_NPC_Dossiers/Undead_Courier_of_the_Mists.md** *(to be created)* for full speech patterns.  
  - Brief sample, hissing through ruined lips:
    > "Too late… too late… the Lord waits for no one. Broken wheels, broken oaths… all roll into the same grave."

- **Tactics:**
  - The wight fights fiercely until reduced to 25% HP; then it tries to retreat into the mists.  
  - If allowed to escape, it can recur later as a haunted messenger.

#### 2.5.3 Mode C: Pure Mood – No Combat

- **No active enemies**, but:
  - Evidence of claw marks, half-eaten horses, and an impression in the road as if something vast and winged had landed here.
  - Perfect when the party is already fatigued or you want to build dread without another fight.

## 3. Encounter: The Hanging Man (Strahd’s Test)

### 3.1 Setup
- **Use When:** You want to show Strahd’s cruel sense of theater and moral testing.  
- **Location:** A tree leaning over the road, its branches warped into grasping claws.

### 3.2 Scene Introduction

> The mist parts just enough to reveal a solitary tree, its bark dark and wet as if freshly bled. From one gnarled branch hangs a shape—a human figure, turning slowly, creaking on a frayed rope.

- Perception DC 10: It is a **man**, barefoot, hands bound behind his back.
- Perception DC 14: His clothes mark him as a **Barovian commoner**, not an outlander.

### 3.3 Moral Hook

- As the party approaches within 20 ft, read:

> The man’s swollen face is mottled purple and gray, eyes clouded, tongue protruding. He is very clearly dead.

- Then, **to any character with a strong moral/heroic streak**, whisper or describe internally:

> Some part of you refuses to accept this. Dead or not, no one should be left like this.

- Prompt: "What do you do?"

### 3.4 Illusion & Strahd’s Observation

This encounter is **illusory but physically interactive**—Strahd’s magic.

1. **Cutting the Rope / Touching the Body:**
   - If a character cuts the rope, the body falls with a heavy, wet thud.
   - The moment anyone touches the corpse:  
     > The body shudders. The swollen features… change. In a nauseating blur, his face reshapes into the face of someone you failed, someone you could not save, or someone you fear losing.

   - Call for **Wisdom saves DC 13**. On failure, that character is **Frightened of the corpse for 1 minute** (or until they pass a new save at the end of each of their turns).

2. **Revelation:**
   - After one full round, the illusion breaks. The corpse becomes just a **faceless, nameless Barovian man** again, slack-jawed and empty.

3. **Strahd’s Presence:**
   - If you want a direct but brief appearance, describe:

> Somewhere above, on an unseen balcony of night, laughter echoes—low, entertained, unmistakably human… and cruel.

   - This is Strahd. He does not intervene further.

Cross-reference: **02_NPC_Dossiers/Strahd_von_Zarovich.md – Section 4.2: Psychological Games on the Road.**

### 3.5 Possible Outcomes

- **They bury the man:**  
  - Gain advantage on future social checks with Barovians who hear of the act (track in **06_Campaign_Trackers/Mists_Arrival_Tracker.md – Section 3: Deeds Witnessed by the Land**).
- **They desecrate or mock the corpse:**
  - The land "remembers." Consider disadvantage on some future divine or good-aligned interventions.
- **They ignore him:**
  - No mechanical change, but this may be a roleplay touchstone later.

## 4. Encounter: The Howling Pack

### 4.1 Purpose
- To foreshadow Barovia’s wolves as Strahd’s eyes and teeth.  
- To give a tense, possibly running battle along the road.

### 4.2 Encounter Options

#### 4.2.1 Mode A: Pure Threat, No Battle

- **Sounds:**
  - A single wolf howl, then another, then a chorus.
  - Perception DC 11: They are **circling** the party, always just out of sight.

- **Narration:**

> Shapes move in the mist at the edge of your vision—lean, low shadows passing between the trees. Sometimes you see eyes, twin glints of pale gold, watching. They never quite step into the open road.

- Use this when the party is low on resources or you want to reserve the first major fight for later.

#### 4.2.2 Mode B: Skirmish on the Road (Standard)

- **Creatures:**
  - 3–6 **Wolves** depending on party level.  
  - Optionally, 1 **Dire Wolf** as a pack leader.

- **Tactics:**
  - Wolves harry the flanks, trying to pull down the weakest or most isolated.
  - They retreat at 50% casualties unless commanded otherwise.

- **Strahd’s Influence:**
  - At any point, you may have the pack suddenly cease attacking and back away, as if seized by an invisible leash.

> Every wolf stops mid-snarl. Ears flatten. Tails tuck. Their eyes lift, not to you… but to some unseen point in the sky or trees. Then, as one, they turn and melt into the forest.

- This hints at Strahd’s dominion over beasts.

#### 4.2.3 Mode C: Chosen Prey (High Tension)

- Pick one PC that has drawn Strahd’s attention (paladin of a sun god, cleric of light, bold leader).
- During the fight, wolves **focus** on this character.

- At some point, that PC hears, in their mind alone:

> "Run for me. Scream for me. Let us see how bright you are when the dark closes in."

- This is Strahd’s telepathic taunt (no save; purely narrative). Track this in **06_Campaign_Trackers/01_Mists_And_Entry_Tracker.md – Section 4: PCs Marked by Strahd**.

## 5. Encounter: The Roadside Shrine

### 5.1 Purpose
- To give the party a **rare note of fragile hope** that is still tinged with decay.  
- To introduce Barovian faith and its erosion under Strahd.

### 5.2 Description

> On the side of the road, half-swallowed by weeds and creeping dead ivy, stands a small stone shrine. Its roof has collapsed, leaving jagged teeth of slate. Inside, behind a rusted iron lattice, you see a cracked stone relief of a woman holding a sunburst to her breast.

- Religion or History DC 12: identify the woman as a **saint or hero of the Morninglord**, once beloved in Barovia.  
- On a higher DC 15+: they recall that Barovia’s faith in the Morninglord has… dimmed.

### 5.3 Interaction Options

1. **They Clean or Repair the Shrine:**
   - The ivy recedes a little; the air slightly warms for a brief moment.
   - Grant a **one-time Bless effect** (no concentration, 1 encounter) to those who sincerely pray here.

2. **They Deface It:**
   - A faint rolling of distant thunder.  
   - If any divine casters present, their next attempt to call on radiant or holy power is colored by a sense of distance.

3. **They Ignore It:**
   - It simply remains another broken hope by the road.

## 6. Structuring the Journey

### 6.1 Example Road Sequence (From Mists to Village)

1. **01_Narration_And_Dialog/01_Mists_And_Entry/01_00_Mists_Seize_the_Party.md** – The party is taken by the mists.
2. **Encounter Choice:** *The Lost Carriage* or *Roadside Shrine*.
3. **Encounter Choice:** *The Howling Pack* (mood or combat).
4. **Encounter Choice:** *The Hanging Man* (moral and horror beat).
5. **Transition to Gates of Barovia** (to be detailed in a future file, e.g. **01_Narration_And_Dialog/01_Mists_Arrival/01_02_Gates_of_Barovia.md**).

### 6.2 Retraction Tools Summary

Use these when players stray off your intended pacing or you need to regroup them:

- **The Lost Carriage:** Appears wherever you need; its crest and letter always point the way deeper into Barovia.
- **The Hanging Man:** Can appear on any stretch of road—a repeated motif that reminds them someone is watching.
- **The Howling Pack:** Sound can come from any direction; guide them subtly back onto the Old Svalich Road.
- **The Roadside Shrine:** A small island of relative safety; if they rest near it, you can gently steer them toward the village at dawn.

Track all uses of these tools in **06_Campaign_Trackers/Mists_Arrival_Tracker.md – Section 5: Roadside Motifs Used**.
