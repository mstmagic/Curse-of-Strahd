# 04_Encounters

Scripted encounters for Curse of Strahd, both from the book and expanded material.

Each encounter file will include:
- **Context & Trigger**: Where/when this happens in the campaign.
- **Objectives**: For Strahd, for other NPCs, and for the environment itself.
- **Battlefield Layout**: Verbal map description plus references to VTT/maps.
- **Monster & NPC List**: With links into `03_Monsters/` and `02_NPC_Dossiers/`.
- **Phases & Beats**: How the encounter evolves round by round, or by trigger.
- **Skill Checks & Interactions**: Non-combat ways players can engage or win.
- **Scaling Guidance**: For weak or strong parties.
- **Aftermath**: Loot, clues, changes to Barovia, shifts in Strahd’s plans.

Encounters will be tightly cross-linked to narration, monsters, NPCs, and trackers so a new DM can pivot in play with minimal prep.
