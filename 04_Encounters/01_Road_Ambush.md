# Encounter: Road Ambush by Dire Wolves

## Setup
- **Location:** Svalich Road between the Mists and Barovia gates.
- **Placement:** Two wolves stalking 40 ft behind, two ahead hidden in brush (DC 14 Perception), alpha on ridge 30 ft to the side.
- **Weather:** Heavy fog; visibility 60 ft. Mud imposes difficult terrain on the ditch edges.

## Objectives
- **Party:** Reach the gates, protect mounts or wagons, avoid being separated.
- **Wolves:** Test prey, knock one target prone and drag into brush.

## Flow
1. **Foreshadow:** Raven feather on the road; distant howl answered from two directions.
2. **Trigger:** When party bunches or investigates feather, wolves strike from front and rear.
3. **Round Beats:**
   - **Round 1:** Alpha howls (no mechanical effect) and uses Help on a prone target.
   - **Round 2+:** Wolves rotate attacks to keep Pack Tactics active. If PCs ignite bright light, wolves circle out of range and ready actions.
4. **Escalation:** If combat drags, bat swarm watches overhead (Strahd scout). Use only as flavor unless you want a charm attempt.
5. **Retreat:** Wolves disengage if two drop or if PCs present radiant/silvered weapons.

## Player Options & Branches
- **Fight Through:** Standard combat; track exhaustion risk if they sprint afterward.
- **Intimidate or Scare Off:** DC 15 Intimidation with loud fire or thunder magic forces a retreat without loot.
- **Climb Trees:** DC 12 Athletics; wolves attempt to knock tree (no effect) then leave.
- **Offer Food:** Tossing a ration buys one round before attack; clever use of raw meat with a high Animal Handling (DC 14) can end fight peacefully.

## Consequences
- **Success:** PCs find a black feather charm (advantage on next Wisdom save vs fear) and 1d4 Barovian silvered trinkets worth 5 gp each.
- **Failure:** A PC is dragged 20 ft and bitten; if unconscious, Strahd’s bat form may appear to watch before leaving a mocking note (11_Items_And_Treasure/Strahd_Note.md).
