# Encounter: Search for Gertruda

## Hook
Mary Hraska pleads for help finding her missing daughter. Tracks point toward the Old Bonegrinder road.

## Setup
- **Location:** Forest path and abandoned campsite.
- **Clues:** Child-sized boot prints, blue scarf snagged on branch, half-eaten dream pastry.
- **Time Pressure:** Rumors say a Vistana wagon passed days ago; delay increases chance Strahd noticed.

## Skill Challenge (3 successes before 2 failures)
- **Survival DC 13:** Follow tracks through mud.
- **Perception DC 12:** Spot raven feather marking safer path; failure leads to sinkhole (Dex save DC 12 or restrained by mud).
- **Insight DC 12:** Recognize false trail laid by hag servant; success grants advantage on next roll.

## Outcomes
- **Success:** Find Gertruda hiding in a hollow tree, exhausted. She is convinced the “dark lord loves her.”
  - **Calm Her:** Persuasion DC 14 or gentle magic; she agrees to return. Adds tension at Burgomaster’s house with Ireena.
  - **Let Her Wander:** She slips away toward the castle; Strahd may return her later as an unsettling gift.
- **Failure:** The trail is lost; encounter a pair of dire wolves instead (use 04_Encounters/01_Road_Ambush.md) and rumor spreads that PCs abandoned her.

## Branches
- **Escort Back:** Villagers offer gratitude in food and gossip (roll twice on 05_Lookup_Tables/Village_Rumors.md).
- **Interrogate:** PCs may learn the hag promised Gertruda a beautiful life; foreshadow Old Bonegrinder.
