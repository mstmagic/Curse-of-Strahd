# Encounter: Night Siege at the Burgomaster's House

## Setup
- **Timing:** First night after PCs arrive; Strahd tests defenses.
- **Forces:** 1d4+1 dire wolves circle and scratch; 2 swarms of bats at windows; distant laughter of Strahd carried by wind.
- **Environment:** Barricaded windows grant half cover; creaking house (see 10_Weather_Atmosphere_Soundscapes/Creaking_House_Ambience.md).

## Objectives
- **Party:** Keep Ireena safe, prevent breaches, survive until dawn or until enemies withdraw.
- **Strahd:** Measure the party; does not fully commit.

## Flow
1. **Ominous Start:** Lights dim, incense snuffed. Scratching at the door. Ask: _“Do you stay silent or confront?”_
2. **Initial Assault:** Wolves batter door (AC 15, 25 HP for the barrier). Bats harry any open window.
3. **Strahd’s Voice:** A calm whisper through the boards: “Little dove, the night is cold. Invite me.”
4. **Escalation Options:**
   - If PCs leave house, wolves attempt to isolate one.
   - Radiant magic or holy symbol brandishing imposes disadvantage on next wolf attacks.
5. **Conclusion:** After 5 rounds or a wolf death, a thunderous knock signals withdrawal. Strahd leaves a note if he observed bravery.

## Player Choices
- **Hold Tight:** Reinforce door (Athletics DC 13 adds 10 HP). Risk suffocation of incense smoke if fire is used inside.
- **Counterattack:** Open door to fight; invites more damage but gains morale with villagers (advantage on future persuasion with locals).
- **Call on Morninglord:** Prayer or bell ringing may attract a raven scout next dawn with intel.

## Consequences
- **Success:** House remains intact; Ireena’s trust gained. PCs rest with interrupted sleep.
- **Failure:** Wolves breach, dealing damage to Ireena; if she drops, Strahd’s charm attempt triggers next night with advantage.
