# Encounter: Road to Old Bonegrinder (Optional Detour)

## Setup
- **Location:** Fork leading away from Barovia toward an old windmill.
- **Placement:** Creepy scarecrows in fields (harmless), hidden hag watcher uses disguise self (do not reveal yet).
- **Weather:** Wind picks up, carrying flour and ash smells.

## Objectives
- **Party:** Decide whether to investigate the windmill or continue to Vallaki.
- **Hag Watcher:** Gauge party strength, lure them later.

## Flow
1. **Signpost:** Cracked sign points “Tser Pool” one way, “Old Mill” another. Footprints of children (small, days old) visible with DC 12 Survival.
2. **Scarecrow Prompt:** A scarecrow jerks in the wind; Investigation DC 12 reveals dried blood on its nails.
3. **Hidden Observer:** Illusion of a traveling peddler (hag) offers dream pastry sample; will not fight now.

## Branches
- **Accept Pastry:** Gain short-lived comfort (temp HP 3) but disadvantage on next Wisdom save vs charm in next day.
- **Refuse:** Hag marks them as troublesome; adds reinforcements in Old Bonegrinder encounter.
- **Follow Children Tracks:** Leads to 04_Encounters/04_Search_For_Gertruda.md.

## Consequences
- **Skipping:** No immediate harm; note that hag reports to Strahd about outsiders.
- **Confrontation:** If attacked, hag flees with dimension door-like escape leaving laughing echo.
