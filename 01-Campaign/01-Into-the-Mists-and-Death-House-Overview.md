# 1. Into the Mists & Death House – Session 1 Overview

> **Intended Party Level:** 1 (advancing to 2 by end of Death House if they survive)
> 
> **Based On:** Curse of Strahd Chapter 1 (Into the Mists) and Appendix B (Death House)
> 
> **Use This File For:** Your very first Barovia session after the characters step into the mists, and for an overview of how to run the Death House as a new DM.

## 1.1. Session Goals for a New DM

1. Introduce the oppressive tone and horror of Barovia.
2. Trap the characters in the mists without them feeling cheated.
3. Give them a focused, haunted-house style adventure (Death House) that teaches:
   - Exploration and mapping
   - Talking to NPCs and spirits
   - Skill checks and saving throws
   - Combat in tight indoor spaces
4. Offer your **first optional Strahd appearances** in subtle, low‑risk ways.

## 1.2. High-Level Flow of Session 1

1. Characters travel in the mists.
2. The Mists close behind them – they are trapped.
3. They arrive at the outskirts of the Village of Barovia.
4. Two ghostly children (Rose and Thorn) ask for help with their "monster in the basement".
5. The characters enter Death House.

Later files will break Death House down room by room with exact narration and dialog. This overview keeps you oriented.

## 1.3. Safety, Consent, and Horror Tone

> **DM Note:** Curse of Strahd is gothic horror. Death, children in danger, body horror, cults, and mind control are common themes.

Before running this campaign, at a separate time (even 10–15 minutes before play), talk briefly with your players:

- Ask what kinds of horror they **enjoy** (ghosts, suspense, mysteries) and what is **off‑limits** (harm to children, torture, graphic gore, etc.).
- Agree on **lines and veils**:
  - A **line** is something that never happens on screen.
  - A **veil** is something that can exist, but you quickly fade to black.
- Tell them they can say "pause" or "fade" at any time, and you’ll pull back.

Keep Death House creepy, but you do **not** need graphic detail. Focus on atmosphere: whispers, cold drafts, rotten smells, eerie toys.

## 1.4. Quick Lore Orientation for You (Not Read-Aloud)

- Barovia is a land trapped in dark, supernatural mists.
- Strahd von Zarovich is an ancient vampire lord who rules everything here.
- The Mists pull in visitors (your characters) and rarely let them leave.
- The Village of Barovia is the oldest and most hopeless of the settlements.
- The Death House is an old townhouse near the village’s edge that once housed a cult that worshiped Strahd.

You don’t need to explain all of this to the players right away. Let the truth reveal itself slowly.

## 1.5. Optional Strahd Involvement in Session 1

In the book, Strahd usually does **not** appear directly during Death House. However, you can safely add **flavor cameos** and **distant influences** without changing the plot.

Use these as tools, not requirements:

1. **Distant Watcher in the Mists (Recommended)**
   - While the party first stumbles through the mists, they see a tall, dark figure on a distant ridge, cloak snapping in wind that does not touch them. His eyes glow like faint coals, then vanish.
   - He never speaks here. This just sets mood.

2. **Portraits in Death House**
   - Several portraits in the house can show Strahd standing with the Durst family, or alone on a balcony of Castle Ravenloft.
   - His eyes seem to follow the characters.

3. **Whisper in the Dark (Only If Players Are Comfortable with Mind-Horror)**
   - At a tense moment, whisper in a soft, amused tone as Strahd’s voice in one character’s mind: "Ah. Fresh souls in my domain." Then silence. No mechanical effect.

Each of these will be written out in detail in the specific scene files.

## 1.6. Campaign Triggers Relevant Here

- **Entering Barovia:** Once the characters fully enter the Mists and cannot leave, the main campaign begins.
- **Death House Hook:** Once they accept Rose and Thorn’s plea and step into the house, you can treat the Death House as a mini-dungeon that will bring them to level 3 by its end (if you choose to follow the book’s XP/level guidelines).
- **Tarokka Reading:** The full Tarokka reading usually happens later at Madam Eva’s camp, **not** during Death House. However, note these future triggers for planning:
  - If a Tarokka card later indicates that an important item or ally is in the Village of Barovia, Death House can foreshadow it with symbols, murals, or journals.

These Tarokka hooks will be referenced in later location files, not in your first session.

## 1.7. What You Need to Prepare Before Session 1

1. **Read Source Material**
   - `Curse of Strahd Book-02-Chapter 1 Into the Mists.md`
   - `Curse of Strahd Book-19-Apendix B Death House.md`

2. **Print or Open at Table**
   - This file (Session 1 Overview).
   - The upcoming detailed files:
     - `01-Campaign/02-Into-the-Mists-Step-by-Step.md`
     - `01-Campaign/03-Barovia-Edge-and-Death-House-Hook.md`
     - `01-Campaign/04-Death-House-1st-Floor.md` (and later floors/areas).

3. **Have At Hand**
   - Your players’ character sheets.
   - Basic rules reference (PHB, quick rules, or SRD).
   - Dice, minis/tokens, scrap paper for quick maps.

4. **Decide Your Strahd Frequency**
   - Before you start, decide how often you want Strahd to appear:
     - **Rarely:** Only distant sightings or rumors during Death House.
     - **Occasionally:** One eerie voice in a character’s head or a dream.
     - **Often:** A bat at the window, a wolf’s howl that responds to their words, or a vision in the fog.

We will mark possible Strahd points as **Strahd Option A/B/C** so you can choose in the moment.

## 1.8. Teaching Yourself to DM While You Run

> **DM Note:** You are new and maybe nervous. That’s normal.

Keep these principles in mind:

1. **You Don’t Have to Perform Perfectly**
   - Read the boxed/narration text out loud. It’s okay to look at the page.
   - If you stumble, just pause, take a breath, and continue.

2. **Ask Players for Help**
   - You can say: "I’m a new DM. I might pause sometimes to check rules or think. That’s normal."
   - Let them know that their ideas matter more than being "correct".

3. **Focus on Three Things**
   - The **scene** (what the characters see, hear, smell).
   - The **choice** (what they can do next).
   - The **consequence** (what happens when they act).

All detailed files in this campaign will be built around those three pillars.

## 1.9. Death House as a Learning Dungeon

Death House teaches both you and the players how Barovia works:

- **Atmosphere over Treasure:** The house feels rich but empty. There are valuables, but something is wrong with all of them.
- **Consequences:** Foolish or reckless actions can be deadly, but there are usually hints and escape routes.
- **Strahd’s Shadow:** Even when he is not present, the house and its history are shaped by his evil.

We will:

- Greatly expand each room with sensory detail.
- Provide multiple **player prompts** such as: "Who approaches the crib?" or "Do you open the wardrobe, or leave it closed?".
- Give **likely player reactions** and suggested DM responses.
