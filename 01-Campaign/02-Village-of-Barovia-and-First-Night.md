# 1. Chapter 2 – The Village of Barovia & First Night in the Devil’s Land

> **DM NOTE (Read silently):** This file is written as a script you can follow almost word‑for‑word. When you see **DM READ ALOUD**, you may read it exactly. When you see **DM CHOICE**, pick the version that best matches your table. Square brackets [like this] are reminders for you, not to be read aloud.

---

## 2. Assumptions & Setup

1. The characters have just finished **Death House** (Appendix B) or another level‑0/1 intro and have emerged onto the Old Svalich Road.
2. The party should be **around level 2** when they first reach the Village of Barovia.
3. They are already trapped in the Mists and know the name **“Barovia”** and **“Strahd”**, at least as rumors.

[If this does not match your campaign start, you can still use this chapter: begin from section **3. Approaching the Village** and pretend they came here directly from the Mists or from another hook.]

---

## 3. Approaching the Village (Old Svalich Road)

### 3.1 Atmosphere & Sensory Details

**DM READ ALOUD:**  
"The road before you is a ribbon of damp earth, swallowed by a forest of black‑barked trees. Their twisted branches knit overhead like grasping fingers, hiding the sky. A cold wind slithers through the undergrowth, bringing with it the stench of wet rot and old smoke.  

To your left and right, the woods vanish into a wall of pale, drifting mist. It curls between the trunks like living breath, never quite touching the road but never far away. Every footstep squelches in the mud. Every exhale blooms as a faint white cloud in the freezing air. Somewhere ahead, a single raven croaks once, then falls silent."  

**Acting Notes (General):**  
- **Voice:** Speak a little more slowly than you normally do. Let some sentences hang for a beat before you continue.  
- **Tone:** Lean into weary, matter‑of‑fact dread. Barovia is not a haunted house jump scare; it is a long, grinding despair.  
- **Body Language:** Hunch forward slightly. Glance at an empty corner of the room as if you heard something, then dismiss it.  

**Silence Prompt:**  
After reading, **say nothing for 5–10 seconds.** Look at the players expectantly. Let them fill the silence.

Then ask: **“What do you do?”**

### 3.2 Likely Player Choices & Your Responses

**If the players say, “We keep following the road”:**  
- **DM RESPONSE (brief):**  
  "You press on. The road bends and twists through the woods, the mist creeping closer with every turn."  
- Move to **3.3 – First Sight of the Village**.

**If the players say, “We go into the woods / explore the forest”:**  
- **DM RESPONSE:**  
  "The trees close around you like bars. The mist thickens between the trunks, cold and heavy. Within a dozen steps, the color starts to drain from the world—greens and browns fading to the same lifeless gray."  
- Call for **DC 12 Wisdom saving throws** from each character.  
  - **Success:** "You feel a pressure at the edges of your mind, a tug urging you to step deeper into the gray. You grit your teeth and force yourself to stop."  
  - **Failure:** "Your thoughts begin to drift and flatten. The forest around you whispers promises of rest—of simply lying down and letting the cold carry you away. Your steps slow until you realize you’ve almost turned around without meaning to."  
- **Effect on a failure:** The character becomes **poisoned** for 10 minutes from oppressive, depressive exhaustion (no damage). If anyone goes more than 60 feet into the Mists, they begin to **choke** (treat as suffocating; they instinctively stumble back to the road).  
- After a short scene in the gray, gently shepherd them back:  
  "No matter which way you wander, the trees twist, the fog thickens, and eventually the road finds you again, like a noose tightening around your neck."  

**If the players say, “We rest here on the road”:**  
- Permit a **short rest**, but make it unsettling.  
- **DM READ ALOUD (if they rest):**  
  "You huddle on the side of the road, the cold mud soaking through cloak and boot. Every now and then, you hear the slow creak of branches… or something that isn’t quite branches. No beasts call. No insects chirp. The only sound is the rasp of your own breath, and the distant, lonely cry of that same raven somewhere ahead."  
- After the rest, nudge them forward with a distant bell toll from the village (see next section).

### 3.3 First Sight of the Village of Barovia

**DM READ ALOUD:**  
"After what feels like hours of tramping through dead leaves and sucking mud, shapes finally appear in the fog ahead—sharp and crooked against the colorless sky.  

A cluster of tall, sagging houses emerges from the mist like rotten teeth. Their doors hang askew. Their windows are dark, some boarded, some broken. Thin threads of smoke bleed from a few chimneys and vanish into the low clouds above.  

At the far end of the muddy road that passes between the houses, a gray shape rises out of the mist—an immense cliff topped by a black fortress of twisted stone. Its towers climb into the clouds like claws. Even from here, you can see the faint orange glow of firelight burning behind its high windows.  

Somewhere in the village, a church bell tolls once… twice… then falls silent."  

**Acting Notes:**  
- When you mention the fortress, pause briefly and look at the players. This is **Castle Ravenloft**. Let it land.  
- Then, quietly add:  
  - **DM OPTIONAL WHISPER (for effect):** *“He is watching.”* (Don’t explain. Move on.)  

**Prompt:**  
"The road leads straight into the village, vanishing between the leaning houses.  

**What do you do?**"

---

## 4. Entering the Village: Empty Streets & Background Life

### 4.1 General Street Description

**DM READ ALOUD:**  
"Your boots splash through puddles as you walk between the houses. The air here is thicker—heavy with the smell of old ash, sour wine, and something faintly metallic, like rusty nails or dried blood.  

The mud‑choked street is lined with simple, two‑story houses of dark wood and stone. Many have their windows shuttered from within. A few show faint candlelight behind warped glass.  

Now and then, the wind carries the sound of a muffled sob, a hoarse lullaby, or the rasp of coughing from behind closed doors. When your steps grow too loud, shutters slam. Curtains twitch. The village is not empty—but its people are hiding."  

**Background NPC Behaviors (Do NOT stat them, they’re just color):**  
Describe 1–2 of these as the party proceeds:  
- A hunched old woman, face wrapped in a gray shawl, swiftly pulling a child inside and barring a door as the players glance her way.  
- A gaunt man smoking a thin, hand‑rolled cigarette on a stoop, watching them with empty eyes, then spitting into the mud.  
- A small group of weary villagers hauling a broken cart wheel, speaking in hushed, resigned tones in a vaguely Eastern‑European accent. They look at the party, then at the sky, as if expecting it to fall.  

**Acting Notes (Villagers in General):**  
- **Voice:** Flat, tired, as if hope has been bled out of them. Use a slight Barovian accent (vaguely Slavic): hard R’s, short vowels.  
- **Attitude:** Fearful, suspicious, but not hostile unless pushed. They have learned that drawing attention often means drawing Strahd.

### 4.2 Optional: Early Strahd Presence (Distant Watcher)

> **Campaign Trigger – Optional Strahd Appearance 1**  
> Use this if you want Strahd to appear early and often. If you want him more mysterious, skip this section.

When the characters first see Castle Ravenloft (or soon after entering town), you may have Strahd watching from afar.

**DM READ ALOUD (Optional):**  
"As you glance up at the distant castle, a faint movement at one of the high balcony windows catches your eye. For a heartbeat, you’re certain you see a tall figure in dark clothes standing there, the glow of firelight behind him. His eyes—impossibly—seem to meet yours across the miles.  

Then the light flickers, and the figure is gone."  

**Acting Notes for Strahd (Distant):**  
- You do not speak as Strahd yet. He is a presence, not a personality at this range.  
- If players ask, "Did he see us?" answer neutrally: **"It felt like it."**

---

## 5. The Weeping House & Mad Mary (Optional Detour)

[This encounter introduces Barovia’s despair and provides roleplay. It is **optional** but highly recommended before reaching the Burgomaster’s mansion.]  

### 5.1 Finding the Weeping House

As the party follows the main street further into town, you can have them notice this automatically, or call for **Passive Perception 10+**.

**DM READ ALOUD:**  
"As you walk, one sound slowly rises above the creak of shutters and the whisper of the wind—sobbing.  

Somewhere ahead, a woman is weeping. The sound is raw, unbroken, and has clearly gone on for a long, long time. It leaks through the cracks of every door and window like a ghost of its own.  

You follow the sound to a tall, narrow house with dark, peeling paint. All its windows are closed. A simple wooden door leans in its frame. The word that comes to mind is not ‘home’ but ‘tomb.’ The sobs seem to shake the entire building."  

**Prompt:**  
"The crying continues, hoarse and steady.  

**What do you do?**"

### 5.2 Likely Player Choices & Responses

**If the players knock on the door:**  
- There is a pause. The sobbing hitches but does not stop. After a moment:  
  - **DM (Villager voice from inside, frightened):**  
    "Go away! Leave her be! This house is cursed enough!"  
- They may need to persuade or insist.

**If the players call out, “Are you all right?” or similar:**  
- **DM RESPONSE:**  
  "The sobs stutter. A woman’s voice, ragged from crying, answers from somewhere upstairs."  
  - **Mad Mary (through tears):**  
    "No… no, I am not all right… I will never be all right again…"  

**If they try to force the door:**  
- The door is old but sturdy. **DC 12 Strength (Athletics)** to break it open.  
- If they break in, you hear gasps from neighboring houses. Shutters slam. No one intervenes.

### 5.3 Inside Mad Mary’s House

**DM READ ALOUD:**  
"The air inside is stale and sour, thick with the smells of old sweat, stale bread, and the faint ammonia stink of chamber pots that haven’t been emptied. Dust lies on every surface.  

The sobbing comes from upstairs."  

Let them explore briefly. The house is bare, with small, cramped rooms, a table bearing a half‑eaten loaf of bread gone hard, and one small locked trunk (containing **15 gp worth of mixed coins**—Mary’s life savings).  

[If they steal from Mary, remember this later for moral weight—but don’t punish mechanically yet.]

### 5.4 Meeting Mad Mary

**NPC: Mad Mary**  
- **Role in Story:** A grieving mother whose daughter **Gertruda** ran away, lured by promises of a “prince” at the castle. Gertruda is now with Strahd. Mary shows the emotional cost of Strahd’s rule.  
- **Voice & Mannerisms:**  
  - Speak in a breathy, exhausted tone that often breaks into sobs.  
  - Repeat phrases. She is stuck in a loop of grief.  
  - Occasionally stare at a wall or window as if expecting Gertruda to appear.  

**DM READ ALOUD (Entering Mary’s room):**  
"At the top of the stairs, you find a small bedroom. The shutters are nailed shut. A thin woman in a once‑fine dress sits on the edge of the bed. Her eyes are red and swollen. Her hair hangs in tangled clumps. Her hands clutch a small, lace‑trimmed doll’s dress so tightly that her knuckles are white.  

She looks up at you with hollow eyes. Tears streak down her face in clean tracks through the dirt."  

**NPC Dialogue – Mad Mary (Opening):**  
- **Mary:**  
  "Who… who are you? More strangers the Mists have brought? Will you vanish like all the others? Will you leave me alone with the echoes?"  

**Prompt to Players:**  
"She watches you with desperate hope and bone‑deep fear.  

**What do you say to her?**"

#### 5.4.1 Likely Player Questions & Mary’s Responses

1. **“Why are you crying?”**  
   - **Mary:**  
     "My daughter… my Gertruda… she is gone. The Mists took her… or the devil did. What does it matter which?"  
2. **“When did she disappear?”**  
   - **Mary:**  
     "Days? Weeks? Time… time is a wheel here. It turns and turns and crushes us under it. She left one night while I slept. I woke to an open door and a cold wind in her room… and she was gone."  
3. **“Do you know where she went?”**  
   - **Mary:**  
     "She dreamed of leaving Barovia. She spoke of a ‘prince’… a man who would take her to a land of light beyond the Mists. She said he called to her in her dreams from the castle on the hill."  
   - [If players connect this to Strahd, let them.]  
4. **“Can we help?” / “What do you want us to do?”**  
   - **Mary (sudden desperate hope):**  
     "Bring her back to me. Please. If she is dead, bring me her bones so I can bury her. If she is… if he has…"  
     [She shudders, unable to finish.]  
     "Just tell her… tell her that I am sorry. I only wanted to keep her safe, and I locked her away. I was wrong. I was wrong."  

**Quest Hook:**  
- The party now has the **Optional Quest: Find Gertruda**.  
- **Campaign Trigger:** When the party later encounters Strahd at Castle Ravenloft, or in any Strahd interaction, you may choose to reveal Gertruda as a toy/hostage/victim depending on tone.

**Loot & Mechanical Info:**  
- If the characters search the house with Mary’s permission, they can find:  
  - **15 gp** hidden in a small trunk (Mary’s savings).  
  - One **silver locket** with a faded miniature of young Gertruda (worth 25 gp, but emotionally priceless to Mary).  
- **Prices:** Mary will not sell anything; she clings to what little she has. If players insist on paying her or giving food, she sobs and thanks them but remains lost in grief.

## 6. Ismark’s Approach – The Burgomaster’s Plea

After some time in the streets (and possibly Mad Mary’s), guide the party toward their first major ally: **Ismark Kolyanovich**.

### 6.1 Who Is Ismark? (For You, Not to Read Aloud)

- Son of **Kolyan Indirovich**, the late burgomaster of Barovia.  
- Brother of **Ireena Kolyana** (adopted).  
- Trying to be a leader but lacks his father’s strength.  
- Wants the characters to escort Ireena safely to the church, then out of the village (eventually to Vallaki).  

**Voice & Acting Notes for Ismark:**  
- **Voice:** Mid‑range, controlled, trying to sound braver than he feels. Barovian accent, but clearer than common villagers.  
- **Attitude:** Polite but urgent. He sizes the party up as potential saviors.  
- **Body Language:** Often glances at shadows or the sky. Keeps hand near weapon. Shoulders carry invisible weight.

### 6.2 First Contact with Ismark

You can have Ismark approach them in the street after he hears there are armed strangers in town.

**DM READ ALOUD:**  
"As you continue along the muddy street, you notice a man step out from the doorway of a tavern‑like building. He is broad‑shouldered, with a weathered face and a short beard. A longsword hangs at his hip. His clothes are simple but well‑kept—dark trousers, a linen shirt, and a sturdy leather coat.  

He studies you with guarded curiosity, then inclines his head."  

**NPC Dialogue – Ismark (Opening):**  
- **Ismark:**  
  "You are not from here. That much is plain. The Mists have been busy again."  
  [He steps closer, keeping his hands visible.]  
  "I am Ismark Kolyanovich. My home is not far from here. I would… speak with you, if you are willing. Somewhere with a door that closes."  

**Prompt:**  
"He looks genuinely anxious, though he does his best to hide it.  

**How do you respond?**"

#### 6.2.1 Likely Player Responses

1. **Friendly acceptance (“Sure, lead the way.”)**  
   - **Ismark:**  
     "Thank you. I promise you—there is food and a fire. We can talk there."  
   - He leads them toward the **Burgomaster’s Mansion** (Section 7).

2. **Suspicion (“Why should we trust you?”)**  
   - **Ismark:**  
     "If you were servants of the devil, you would not need my trust—and you would not walk the streets in daylight. I have no power to force you. Only a plea: my family needs help. If you will not come, then say so, and I will trouble you no more."  
   - If they remain suspicious but not hostile, offer:  
     - **Ismark:**  
       "Walk behind me, if you like. Keep your weapons in hand. I will not take offense."  

3. **Hostile / “We don’t have time.”**  
   - **Ismark (stiffening, hurt but composed):**  
     "Very well. Then I will say this and leave you be: if you value your lives, do not wander the streets at night, and do not draw the attention of the castle."  
   - He steps back. You can later have him re‑approach if they struggle.

**Silence Prompt:**  
After players debate, simply watch them, hands folded, and let them decide. This is an early moment for them to feel agency.

---

## 7. The Burgomaster’s Mansion

### 7.1 Exterior & First Impression

**DM READ ALOUD:**  
"Ismark leads you through the winding streets until you reach a large, two‑story house near the edge of the village.  

Unlike the sagging homes around it, this house was clearly fine once—its stone walls carefully laid, its windows framed by carved wooden trim. But now its glory is cracked and dying.  

The windows are shattered and boarded. The gate hangs askew on broken hinges. The walls are pockmarked with dozens of claw marks and blackened by fire. Hanging from the front gate by rusty nails are a dozen faded, torn holy symbols—desperate charms that clearly failed.  

Two ravens sit on the roof, watching silently with bright, intelligent eyes."  

**Acting Notes (Ravens):**  
- Occasionally describe a raven fluttering or giving a soft caw when Strahd or danger is mentioned. They’re subtle omens and potential allies (Wereravens of the Keepers of the Feather). Do not explain this yet.

### 7.2 Entering the Mansion

Ismark knocks in a familiar pattern, then opens the door and gestures them inside.

**Ismark:**  
"Please. Come in quickly. The house is… safer than the street, for now. Safer still if we keep the door closed."  

**DM READ ALOUD (Interior):**  
"The air inside the mansion is thick with the smell of cold ashes, old wood polish, and something darker—like flowers left too long in water.  

The entry hall is cramped but carefully kept. A few framed portraits hang crooked on the walls, their subjects’ eyes watching you with tired faces. Thick curtains hang over the windows, blocking the sickly daylight.  

Somewhere deeper in the house, you hear the crackle of a fire and the soft murmur of a woman’s voice."  

Ismark guides them toward the sitting room, where **Ireena** waits.

---

## 8. Meeting Ireena Kolyana

### 8.1 Who Is Ireena? (For You)

- Adopted daughter of the late burgomaster, raised as his own.  
- Brave, proud, stubborn, and determined not to be a victim.  
- Strahd has already bitten her **twice**; she bears the marks, and his obsession centers on her.

**Voice & Acting Notes for Ireena:**  
- **Voice:** Clear, steady, with a controlled Barovian accent. She is not broken; she is resolute.  
- **Attitude:** Suspicious at first but fair. She tests the party’s resolve.  
- **Body Language:** Upright posture, strong eye contact. One hand often rests unconsciously near a scarf covering her neck.

### 8.2 First Impression

**DM READ ALOUD:**  
"Ismark leads you into a modest sitting room. A small fire burns stubbornly in the hearth, doing its best to chase away the chill.  

A young woman stands near the window, one hand on the curtain as if she has been watching the street. Her hair is a rich auburn, braided back from a strong, pale face. She wears a simple but well‑made dress and a sword belt at her hip. A dark scarf is wrapped around her throat.  

Her eyes—sharp and wary—fix on you as you enter."  

**Ismark:**  
"Ireena… these are the ones I told you of. Strangers, armed and unafraid of the road. Perhaps the help we prayed for."  

**Ireena (coolly):**  
"We will see."  

**Prompt:**  
"She studies you for a long moment, then inclines her head a fraction.  

**What do you say or do?**"

### 8.3 Likely Dialogue & Ireena’s Answers

1. **“What do you need from us?”**  
   - **Ireena:**  
     "I need nothing from you. Barovia, however, needs a miracle—and my brother thinks you might be it."  
     [She glances at Ismark.]  
     "Our father, Kolyan Indirovich, the burgomaster, is dead. He died three days past, his heart finally giving out under the strain of… nightly visitors."  

2. **“Nightly visitors?”**  
   - **Ismark:**  
     "Wolves. Bats. Things that scratched at the walls. And sometimes, worse. The devil himself came to our door, calling for Ireena by name."  
   - **Ireena (quiet but firm):**  
     "He will not have me. I would sooner die on the walls of this wretched village than bow to him."  

3. **“Why does Strahd want you?”**  
   - **Ireena (shakes her head):**  
     "He does not explain himself. He speaks of destiny, of past lives. He calls me ‘Tatyana’ sometimes, as if I am someone else."  
   - [Do not over‑explain Tatyana yet. Let players speculate.]

4. **“What do you want us to do?”**  
   - **Ismark:**  
     "First, help us bury our father. His body lies in the next room, waiting for a priest who fears to come. We would bring him to the church on the hill, but the road is dangerous… and the devil’s eyes are on us."  
   - **Ireena:**  
     "After that, my brother wishes to send me away—to Vallaki, or further. Somewhere the devil’s grip is weaker. If such a place exists."  

**Silence Prompt:**  
Once this plea is laid out, stop. Let the players talk amongst themselves. Only speak again if they ask a direct question.

---

## 9. The Corpse of the Burgomaster

### 9.1 Showing the Body

If the players agree to help—or even if they are unsure—Ismark offers to show them his father.

**Ismark:**  
"Will you at least come and pay your respects? Perhaps if you see what this land does to its leaders, you will understand our desperation."  

He leads them to the adjoining room.

**DM READ ALOUD:**  
"The next room smells strongly of candles and faintly of decay, sweet and sickening.  

In the center of the room rests a simple wooden coffin on two trestles. Dozens of candles surround it, their wax pooled and hardened in rivulets down the stands. Inside the coffin lies an older man with a broad, lined face, his hands folded over his chest. Someone has dressed him in his best clothes and combed his thinning hair.  

Even in death, his jaw is set with stubborn resolve."  

**Ismark (softly):**  
"Kolyan Indirovich. My father. He held this village together as long as any man could. The devil broke him heart first."  

### 9.2 Player Reactions

If players offer condolences, allow Ismark and Ireena brief responses.

- **If they say, “We’re sorry for your loss.”**  
  - **Ismark:**  
    "You did not know him, but I thank you all the same."  
- **If they ask about wounds or cause of death:**  
  - A **DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine)** check reveals:  
    - He died of natural causes—likely a heart attack or similar stress‑related failure. No vampire wounds, but he bears the exhaustion of many sleepless nights.

**Campaign Trigger – Optional Strahd Attention 2:**  
- If you want Strahd’s awareness to be very present, you may decide that **Strahd becomes directly interested** once the party agrees to escort Ireena or help with the burial.  
- This will justify an optional Strahd encounter at the church or later tonight (Section 11).

---

## 10. Planning the Burial & First Night Timeline

At this point, the characters should understand:  
- The burgomaster is dead.  
- Ireena is being hunted by Strahd.  
- The village is oppressed and afraid.

They have a clear, immediate task: **help transport the body to the church and see it buried**.

### 10.1 Suggested Timeline for a New DM

To keep things clear, use this order for the rest of the day and night:  

1. **Afternoon:** Arrive in town, meet Mad Mary (optional), meet Ismark & Ireena, see the body.  
2. **Late Afternoon:** Escort the coffin up to the church. Meet Father Donavich and Doru.  
3. **Evening:** Burial of Kolyan at the church.  
4. **Night:** Either return to the mansion to sleep or stay at the church. Optional **Strahd visitation** at whichever location they choose.

This file covers up through planning and preparing to leave for the church. A subsequent chapter file will handle the **Church of the Morninglord**, **Doru**, and the **nighttime Strahd event** in detail.

### 10.2 Player Choice: Rest Now or Go to the Church

After viewing the body, let the conversation steer naturally, then offer a gentle structure.

**Ismark:**  
"Father Donavich at the church will perform the rites, if we can bring the coffin to him. But the road grows more dangerous as the light fades. If you wish to rest first, we can wait until morning—though my father has waited long enough."  

**Prompt to Players:**  
"Do you:  
- **A.** Help carry the coffin to the church now, before night fully falls?  
- **B.** Rest here first and go in the morning?  
- **C.** Refuse to get involved—for now?"  

#### 10.2.1 If They Choose A – Go Now

- You will run a short journey through the village to the church with risk of **wolf or zombie encounters** and tension from villagers watching. This will be covered in the **next chapter file**.  
- Note that this choice likely leads to a **nighttime Strahd encounter at the church**, if you want it.

#### 10.2.2 If They Choose B – Rest First

- Allow them to take a **short or long rest** at the mansion.  
- During rest, play up the sounds of the night:  
  - Distant howls.  
  - Scratching at shutters.  
  - The wind carrying a faint, eerie snatch of organ music from the distant castle.  
- Optional: Use this night for a **Strahd visitation at the mansion** (looking in through windows, testing Ireena, or simply circling like a predator). This will be detailed in the next chapter.

#### 10.2.3 If They Choose C – Refuse

- **Ismark:**  
  "I see. Then forgive me. I had hoped for more from you than the devil’s fear has left in the rest of us."  
- He will **not** attack or expel them but becomes cold.  
- You can give them time to explore town. Eventually, new dangers and a worsening situation (and maybe an appearance from Strahd) should pressure them back toward involvement.

---

## 11. Optional Strahd Interaction Seeds in the Village

These are **hooks**, not full scenes. They are offered so you can decide how present Strahd feels tonight and in the coming days.

Use **1–3 of these**, not all at once.

1. **The Whisper at the Window (Mansion Night):**  
   - As the party prepares for bed, one awake character near a window hears a calm, cultured male voice just outside the shutter:  
     - **Strahd (softly):**  
       "You do not belong to this land… and yet, here you are. Tell me, little moth—do you hope to flee the flame, or to kill it?"  
   - If they fling open the shutter, there is no one—only a swirling, bat‑choked sky and a faint scent of blood and roses.

2. **The Passing Carriage (Street at Dusk):**  
   - As they walk the streets at dusk, they hear the clatter of hooves. A black carriage, drawn by a pair of midnight horses with burning red eyes, rolls by.  
   - A pale, handsome man in rich black clothing sits inside, gloved hand resting on the sill. He lifts a glass of deep red wine to them in a mocking toast as the carriage passes. No attack—just a greeting.  

3. **The Dream of the Balcony (Sleeping Character):**  
   - One character dreams of standing on a castle balcony beside a dark‑haired nobleman (Strahd), overlooking a sunlit valley that does not exist anymore. His voice is warm, his hand gentle as he touches their shoulder:  
     - **Strahd:**  
       "Once, this land knew light. Once, I knew peace. Would you like to see it returned? Help me, and I will free you from these chains of fate."  
   - The character wakes with the faint imprint of a hand on their shoulder and the taste of old wine in their mouth.

4. **Campaign Trigger – Tarokka Connection:**  
   - If you have **already performed the Tarokka reading** (perhaps with Madam Eva on the way here), tie Strahd’s words to the reading. For example:  
     - If a card revealed **“The Innocent”** as linked to Ireena, Strahd might say:  
       - "The cards turn, and the innocent stands in the center of the spread. How far will you go to keep her from me?"  
     - If a card revealed a holy place of power (like the church, the abbey, or the temple), Strahd might allude to it as "that last flicker of hope you will soon smother with your own hands."

## 12. Closing This Chapter

By the time you finish using this file, the players should:  
- Know **Ismark**, **Ireena**, **Mad Mary** (optional), and the mood of the village.  
- Feel the constant presence of **Strahd** as a watching, manipulative force.  
- Have a clear next step: **escorting the coffin to the church** and enduring their **first full night in Barovia**.

The next file in `01-Campaign` should cover:  
- The **Village of Barovia Church** in detail.  
- **Father Donavich** and his son **Doru**.  
- The **burial scene** with possible undead interference.  
- A full, script‑style **Strahd confrontation or near‑miss**—your choice of intensity.
