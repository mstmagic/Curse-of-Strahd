# 1. Death House Interior – Ground Floor (For Levels 1–3)

> This script begins the moment the characters step across the threshold of the Durst family house and into the foyer. Run this only after they have already met Rose and Thorn outside and chosen to enter.

---

## 1.1 Dungeon Master Overview

- **Recommended level**: 1–3 (freshly trapped in Barovia).
- **Tone**: Slow-burn Gothic horror; the house feels *watchful* but not immediately lethal.
- **Goal of this file**: Give a brand‑new, shy DM *every line* they need to:
  - Narrate the transition from street to foyer.
  - Run the ground floor rooms (Foyer, Main Hall, Den of Wolves, Kitchen & Pantry, Dining Room, Closet, Servants’ Hall, Servants’ Door to Basement, and Main Stair).
  - Handle early paranoia, exploration, and first hints that the house is alive.
- **Combat on this floor**: None by default. You may add **optional** minor encounters for pacing; these are clearly marked.
- **Strahd**: No direct appearance, but his influence is felt in whispers, shadows, and symbolism.

**Acting principle for this whole file:**
> Speak slowly, leave long pauses, and rarely answer questions directly. Let the house answer instead.

When you see:
- **[READ ALOUD]** – Read the text **word for word**.
- **[SAY AS NPC]** – Read in character, using the voice notes given.
- **[DM NOTE]** – Guidance just for you; don’t read aloud.
- **[SILENCE]** – Stop talking and look at the players; give them space.

## 2. Entering the Foyer (Area 1)

### 2.1 First Step Inside – Boxed Text

**[READ ALOUD]**
"Crossing the threshold, you leave the chill fog‑choked street behind. The front door swings inward with a long, reluctant creak and closes softly at your backs.

You stand in a **narrow foyer** paneled in dark, polished wood. The air smells faintly of **old pipe smoke**, **lemon oil**, and something else—**stale flowers left too long in a vase**. A black **iron coat rack** leans against one wall, its hooks empty. Straight ahead, a set of double doors with **stained glass panes** shows children at play, frozen behind a film of dust.

A red **woven rug** muffles your footsteps. The only sound is the faint ticking of a clock somewhere deeper in the house… and the slow **wheeze of the wind** pressing against the walls.

For just a moment, you all feel the same, strange sensation: as though the house is **exhaling**, relieved that you have come inside."

**[SILENCE]**
Look around the table. Let them talk.

### 2.2 Player Inquiry Prompts

If players hesitate, offer gentle prompts.

**[DM PROMPT – IF THEY STAND STILL]**

**[READ ALOUD]**
"The door behind you feels strangely heavy, as if the wood has swollen with damp. The double doors ahead wait patiently, their dusty glass panes catching your reflections in faint, murky colors.

What do you do?"

If a player checks the front door:

**Most likely player actions and your responses:**

1. **Player:** "I try to open the front door again."
   - **[DM NOTE]**: The front door *can* open for now, but it resists slightly. Later, after they reach higher floors, it will seal.
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "You pull on the brass handle. For a heartbeat, it refuses to move—then it jerks open with a sticky sound, like peeling wet bark from a tree. The grey street and rolling white mist lie beyond, cold and empty.

     The moment you release the handle, the door eases itself closed again with a soft click."  
   - **[DM PROMPT]** "Do you step back out into the fog, or do you stay inside?"

2. **Player:** "Is there anything in the foyer to search?"
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "Aside from the coat rack, the rug, and the stained‑glass doors, the foyer is bare. No boots, no cloaks, no umbrellas—no sign that anyone has come or gone in some time."  
   - **[DM PROMPT]** "Do you try the stained‑glass doors, or investigate something else?"

3. **Player:** "I listen carefully."
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "You hold your breath. The house seems to be holding its breath with you. Then you catch it: a **regular ticking**, like a clock, somewhere ahead and to the right… and a faint, rhythmic **scrape**, like branches or something else brushing against a window."  
   - **[DM PROMPT]** "Do you follow the ticking, or head somewhere else?"

### 2.3 Moving into the Main Hall (Area 2)

When they open the stained‑glass doors:

**[READ ALOUD]**
"The stained‑glass doors open on **well‑oiled hinges**, moving more smoothly than you expect. A larger **hall** stretches before you, its walls covered with **carved wooden panels** from floor to ceiling.

The woodwork shows **twining vines, flowers, and nymphs**, all rendered with loving detail. A **black marble fireplace** faces you from the far wall, cold and empty. A **red marble staircase** rises along the left wall, curving up to the second floor. Mounted above the fireplace is a **longsword** with a silver hilt, set against the stylized carving of a **coiled golden windmill**.

The air is still, heavy with the smell of **beeswax polish** and **cold stone**. A grandfather clock ticks steadily somewhere close—steady, like a heartbeat the house has chosen for itself."

**[SILENCE]**

Then:

**[DM PROMPT]** "Where do you go, and what do you do?"

---

## 3. Main Hall – Exploration Structure

On this floor, the characters can find: 
- The **den of wolves** (trophy room),
- The **kitchen** and **pantry**,
- The **formal dining room**,
- **Servants’ areas** (small hall, back stair, door to basement—locked for now),
- **Staircase** to the upper floors.

You don’t need to push them into any specific order. Use the following guidance.

### 3.1 How to Portray the House Itself

**Voice / Presence of the House**
- You may treat the house like a silent NPC.
- It never speaks out loud, but you describe its reactions.

**[DM NOTE – HOUSE REACTIONS]**
- When players:
  - **Light a torch**: The flame gutters, colors on the walls look wrong.
  - **Raise voices**: The clock seems to tick louder; a draft sighs.
  - **Draw weapons**: The carved faces in the paneling seem harsher, more predatory.

Use neutral but unsettling lines:
- "The house doesn’t seem to like that."
- "Something in the walls creaks, like an old spine twisting."

Do **not** actually attack them with the house yet; save that for later floors.

---

## 4. The Black Marble Fireplace & Windmill Sword

### 4.1 Visual & Sensory Detail

When someone approaches the fireplace or the sword:

**[READ ALOUD]**
"Up close, the black marble of the fireplace is polished to a dull shine, veined with pale grey streaks like **frozen lightning**. The carved windmill above it, picked out in flaking gold leaf, seems almost to turn when you look at it from the corner of your eye.

The longsword above the mantle is **sheaved in dust**. Its silver hilt is worked in the shape of spiral clouds, its crossguard two outstretched wings. The blade itself is secured to the wall by thin iron brackets."  

**Texture & Smell:**
- The mantle is cold and slightly gritty with soot.
- The sword smells faintly of **old oil** and **tarnished metal** if handled.

### 4.2 Likely Player Actions

1. **Player:** "Can I take the sword?"
   - **[DM NOTE]**: In the original adventure, this is a decorative, nonmagical longsword. You may allow it as a normal longsword.
   - **If they reach up and take it:**
     - **[READ ALOUD]**
       "You tug the sword free from its brackets. Dust rains down in a thin grey curtain. For a heartbeat, the carved windmill on the wall behind it seems to **spin**, its blades whirring in the corner of your eye… but when you blink, it’s still.

       The sword has a solid weight in your hand—well‑made, but utterly mundane."
     - **[DM NOTE]**: Treat this as a **standard longsword** (no bonus). Market value in Barovia: **15 gp** if sold to the right buyer in a larger town.

2. **Player:** "I examine the carvings more carefully."
   - **[DM NOTE]**: The original woodwork hides creepy shapes that emerge at higher floors. On the ground floor, keep it subtle.
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "At first, you see only vines and flowers. Then, among the leaves, you spot a shape that might be a **wolf’s muzzle**, another that might be a **skull**, another that could be a **screaming face**. It’s hard to tell—your eyes keep slipping away, unsure whether the shapes were always there.

     The longer you stare, the more you feel as if the carvings are slowly **deciding** what you see in them."
   - **[DM PROMPT]** "Do you keep studying the woodwork, or step away?"

3. **Player:** "Is there anything in the fireplace?"
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "Cold ashes coat the inside of the hearth, long undisturbed. A faint, sooty smell clings to the brick.

     As you brush at the ashes, you uncover a few calcified **chicken bones**, blackened at the ends—and one small bone that might be **human**, or might just be a trick of the light."  
   - **[DM PROMPT]** "Do you keep digging, or leave it alone?"

**Optional Minor Horror (No Mechanical Effect):** If a player keeps digging in the ashes:
- **[READ ALOUD]**
  "Your fingers close on something small and brittle. When you pull it free, you recognize the curved shape of a **child’s milk tooth**, scorched black at the root. It crumbles to dust between your fingers."

---

## 5. Den of Wolves (Trophy Room – Area 3)

### 5.1 Approaching the Door

The den is usually accessed from the main hall.

**[READ ALOUD – WHEN THEY OPEN THE DOOR]**
"You open the door into a **cozy, wood‑paneled room** that smells faintly of **old leather**, **stale tobacco**, and **dusty fur**.

Pressed against the walls are **leather‑upholstered chairs** and a low table set with a dusty deck of **playing cards** and a few yellowed **poker chips**. A **chandelier** hangs overhead, its candles burned down to **stubs of hardened wax**.

Towering above the fireplace is the mounted head of a **massive wolf**, its glass eyes catching the light in a lifeless stare. More **hunting trophies**—antlers, smaller animal heads, and framed sketches—adorn the walls.

A cabinet with glass doors stands in one corner, showing off rows of **bottles** and **cut crystal glasses**, their surfaces filmed with dust."

**[SILENCE]**
Let them explore and comment.

### 5.2 How to Play This Room

The den is a place to:
- Let the players relax slightly.
- Reinforce the theme of **predator and prey**.
- Offer **small, mundane loot**.

**Acting notes (House in this room):**
- Speak in a slightly **hushed** tone, as though in a gentleman’s club.
- When players disturb things, mention faint **settling noises** from the ceiling above, as though something is shifting its weight.

### 5.3 Searching the Den – Likely Actions

1. **Player:** "I examine the wolf’s head."
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "Up close, the wolf’s head is even larger—its jaws frozen in a silent snarl, yellowed teeth bared. The fur is dry and brittle to the touch, and when you brush it, a faint cloud of **dust and old, animal smell** rises into the air.

     Its glass eyes seem to follow you as you move."
   - **[DM NOTE]**: No attack. It is just taxidermy, but play up the unease.
   - **If they poke its mouth or try to remove teeth:**
     - **[READ ALOUD]**
       "You pry at one of the yellow teeth. With a soft crack, it comes free in your fingers, leaving behind a dark, empty socket. No blood—just the dry rasp of dust."  
     - **Loot:** 1d4 wolf’s teeth (no monetary value unless you decide differently).

2. **Player:** "What’s in the cabinet?"
   - **[DM NOTE]**: Per book, the cabinet holds a wine collection (mostly worthless but drinkable), and some good glassware.
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "Inside the glass‑fronted cabinet, you see several dusty **wine bottles**, some with cracked seals, others intact. Cut **crystal tumblers** and **wineglasses** gleam faintly in the dim light. A thin, sour smell of old alcohol leaks out when you open the doors."
   - **Loot (suggested, adjust as needed):**
     - 6 bottles of common red wine (**2 gp each** if sold; drinkable but sour).
     - 2 bottles of better, labeled Barovian regional wine (GM pick, e.g., *Red Dragon Crush* from the Wizard of Wines) (**10 gp each** if identified and sold in Vallaki or beyond).
     - 8 crystal glasses (**5 gp each**, 40 gp total if sold as a set).
   - **[DM PROMPT]** "Do you take any of the bottles or glasses, or leave them?"

3. **Player:** "I check the table and cards."
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "The cards are brittle and stained with dark, circular **wine rings**. When you disturb them, you notice that someone, long ago, scratched tiny **notches** into the corners of certain cards.

     The poker chips are cheap, painted wood—some with tiny teeth marks along the edge."  
   - **[DM NOTE]**: No mechanical effect, just color. If you like, a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check can reveal the deck is **marked**.
   - **If they succeed and ask what that means:**
     - **[READ ALOUD]**
       "Someone used this deck to **cheat**, carving tiny signals into the corners. Whoever played here didn’t expect to be caught—or didn’t care if they were."  
   - **Loot:** Marked deck of cards (no fixed price; maybe **1–5 gp** to a gambler).

4. **Player:** "I search the room for hidden things."  
   - **[DM NOTE]**: Unless you want to add extra treasure, this room is mostly tapped out after wine and crystal. However, you can reward a good Investigation check.
   - **Optional Reward (DC 15 Investigation):**
     - **[READ ALOUD]**
       "Feeling along the underside of the table, your fingers brush against a **small ridge** of hardened wax. Pressed into it is a **silver signet ring**, its face bearing the windmill symbol you saw above the main fireplace."
     - **Loot:** Silver signet ring with Durst family windmill sigil (**25 gp**).

### 5.4 Optional Encounter – The Watching Eyes

This is an **optional, no‑damage** scare.

- **Trigger:** After 10–15 minutes of in‑game time in the den, or if the players start to relax.
- **[READ ALOUD]**
  "As you move about the room, you become slowly aware of a **prickling sensation** between your shoulders, as though you are being watched.

  When you glance at the hunting trophies, you realize what it is: all the **glass eyes**, all the **painted animal faces**, all the half‑sketched prey in their frames—somehow they all seem to be **angled toward you now**, where before they were not."
- **[DM NOTE]**: If any player wants to resist panic or see through the illusion, allow a **DC 12 Wisdom saving throw**.
  - **On success:**
    - **[READ ALOUD]**
      "You blink hard and look again. The trophies and sketches are exactly where they were. The feeling of being watched remains, but you tell yourself it’s only your nerves."
  - **On failure:**
    - **[READ ALOUD]**
      "You can’t shake the certainty that something—*someone*—is enjoying this, watching your every move from just out of sight. The hairs on your arms stand on end."
    - **[DM NOTE]**: No mechanical penalty; it just informs roleplay. Encourage the player to describe how unsettled their character feels.

**[DM PROMPT]** "This house was built by hunters. Now it feels like it’s hunting you. What do you do?"

---

## 6. Kitchen & Pantry (Areas 4 and 5)

### 6.1 Entering the Kitchen

The kitchen connects to the den and/or the servants’ hall, depending on your map.

**[READ ALOUD – OPENING THE KITCHEN DOOR]**
"The next door opens into a **narrow kitchen**. The smell of **stale grease** and **cold ashes** washes over you.

A **large black iron stove** dominates one wall, its pipe vanishing into the ceiling. Stacks of **neatly arranged pots and pans** hang from hooks above a scarred wooden counter, all coated in a thin layer of dust.

A basin with a long‑dry **hand pump** sits beneath a small window. The glass beyond is opaque with grime, letting in a weak, grey light.

A second doorway leads into what looks like a **small pantry**, crammed with shelves."

**[SILENCE]**

Then:

**[DM PROMPT]** "The room feels unused, but not abandoned. What do you do?"

### 6.2 Exploring the Kitchen – Likely Actions

1. **Player:** "I check the stove."
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "The stove is cold to the touch. When you open the iron door, the stink of **old, burned fat** wafts out. Inside, you find a crust of charcoal and a few unidentifiable blackened lumps—maybe once meat, now just ash and bone."
   - **Optional Creepy Detail:**
     - **[READ ALOUD]**
       "One of the blackened shapes collapses under your touch, revealing a **tiny metal fork**, warped by heat and stained dark."  
     - **Loot:** Child‑sized metal fork (no real value, just unsettling).

2. **Player:** "Does the pump work?"
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "You work the hand pump. At first, nothing happens but a dry **squeak**. Then, with a grinding **gurgle**, a few spurts of **rust‑colored water** cough out into the basin, streaking the porcelain with orange."
   - **[DM NOTE]**: The water is not poisonous but tastes metallic and stale.

3. **Player:** "Any knives or weapons?"
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "A wooden knife block holds a row of **kitchen knives**—their blades spotted with rust, but still sharp enough to cut."
   - **Loot:**
     - 3–5 kitchen knives (treat as **daggers**, but cosmetically kitchen tools). **Price:** 2 gp each.

4. **Player:** "Is there any food?"
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "Not here—the counters are bare, and the cupboards hold only clean, empty plates and bowls. If there was food, it was cleared away long ago."

### 6.3 The Pantry

When someone enters or peers into the pantry:

**[READ ALOUD]**
"The pantry is lined with **wooden shelves** from floor to ceiling, sagging under the weight of **dusty jars**, **cloth‑wrapped bundles**, and **bottles** with peeling labels.

The air smells sour and **slightly moldy**, like old flour and dried herbs gone to dust."

#### 6.3.1 Searching the Pantry

1. **Player:** "I look for anything still good to eat."
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "Most of the food here is ruined—glass jars clouded with **fuzzy mold**, cloth‑wrapped loaves turned to hard stone, and sacks of grain that squirm faintly with unseen **weevils** when you touch them.

     Still, you find a few things that might be salvageable."  
   - **Loot (suggested):**
     - 2–3 small jars of preserved fruit or jam, barely edible (**1 gp each**).
     - 1 sealed tin of tea leaves (**3 gp**).

2. **Player:** "Anything more valuable? Wine? Spirits?"
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "Tucked away behind a row of rotting cloth bundles, you uncover a tall, narrow **green bottle**. The faded label shows the outline of a **windmill** and text in Barovian script."  
   - **[DM NOTE]**: This can be a precursor bottle from the Wizard of Wines, e.g., a cheap *Grapemash No. 3*.
   - **Loot:** 1 bottle common Barovian wine (**5 gp** in a village tavern or to a thirsty traveler).

3. **Player:** "I search for hidden compartments or doors."
   - **[DM NOTE]**: By default, there’s nothing here, but you may place a clue or optional hook.
   - **Optional Clue to Future Horror (No Treasure):**
     - **[READ ALOUD]**
       "Behind a row of empty jars, your hand brushes a scrap of **paper** wedged into a crack in the paneling. When you tug it free, you find a torn corner of a **recipe page**—the words smeared but still legible in places.

       You can make out phrases like ‘…marinade the flesh…’ and ‘…ensure the bones are **well‑scraped**…’ but the rest is too damaged to read. It might be for cooking… or something else."

**[DM PROMPT]** "You’ve seen where the house’s meals were prepared. What do you do now?"

---

## 7. Formal Dining Room (Area 6)

### 7.1 Entering the Dining Room

The dining room connects to the main hall.

**[READ ALOUD – OPENING THE DOOR]**
"You open a pair of **polished wooden doors** into an **elegant dining room**.

A long **mahogany table** dominates the space, its surface shining under a thin coat of dust. Eight **high‑backed chairs** stand at precise intervals along its sides, each with carved backs in the shape of **climbing roses**.

The table is set with **gleaming silverware**, **crystal goblets**, and **fine china plates** painted with delicate **windmills** and rolling **barley fields**. A crystal chandelier hangs overhead, its faceted drops catching the dim light and scattering it in cold, tiny rainbows.

A woven **tapestry** on one wall shows hunting dogs and noble riders chasing a fleeing **wolf** into a dark forest."

**[SILENCE]**

Then:

**[DM PROMPT]** "The room looks ready for a meal that never came. What do you do?"

### 7.2 Exploring the Dining Room – Details & Loot

1. **Player:** "I inspect the table settings."
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "Every place is laid with painstaking care. The silverware is lightly tarnished but beautifully made, each handle engraved with the tiny symbol of a **windmill**. The plates are thin and delicate; when you tap one, it gives a faint **porcelain ring**.

     Some of the goblets still hold a thin, dried **red residue** at the bottom. You can’t tell if it was wine… or something thicker."  
   - **Loot (if they gather up valuables):**
     - 8 place settings of silver cutlery (**25 gp per setting; 200 gp total** if sold as a full set to a wealthy buyer).
     - 8 fine china plates (**5 gp each; 40 gp total**).
     - 8 crystal goblets (**10 gp each; 80 gp total**).
   - **[DM NOTE]**: If players try to carry *all* of this, mention the noise and encumbrance.

2. **Player:** "I look closely at the tapestry."
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "The tapestry’s threads are faded but still rich in places. The **dogs** tear at the hindquarters of the fleeing wolf, their mouths full of thread‑bright blood. The riders’ faces are shadowed beneath their helms, but you can see their hands—white‑knuckled on the reins, their fingers long and almost **claw‑like**.

     In the far background, just hinted at between the trees, stands a **tall, distant castle** perched on a cliff, its windows like tiny, staring eyes."  
   - **[DM NOTE]**: The castle is Ravenloft; this is foreshadowing.

3. **Player:** "Any hidden things in the room?"
   - **[DM NOTE]**: You may allow a DC 15 Perception/Investigation check to spot a loose floorboard near the head of the table.
   - **On success:**
     - **[READ ALOUD]**
       "Near the head of the table, you notice a faint **scuff mark** on the floor, as if a chair was dragged back and forth in the same spot many times. Probing around, you find a floorboard that shifts slightly under your weight."
     - If they pry it up:
       - **[READ ALOUD]**
         "Beneath the loose board rests a small **tin box**, spotted with rust. Inside, wrapped in a square of stiff, stained cloth, you find **twelve gold coins**, each stamped with a foreign crest—an unfamiliar king’s profile on one side and a **towering castle** on the other."  
       - **Loot:** 12 gp (Barovian mint; can be spent normally in Barovia, but may be strange if they ever escape).

### 7.3 Optional Social Horror – Ghost Guests (No Combat)

Use this if the scene feels flat and you want a subtle, roleplay‑heavy chill.

- **Trigger:** If the characters sit at the table or spend more than 5–10 minutes here.
- **[READ ALOUD]**
  "As you linger in the dining room, the air grows subtly **warmer**, like the press of unseen bodies.

  Out of the corner of your eye, you think you see **shapes** taking the empty chairs—pale blurs of powdered wigs, lace cuffs, and high collars. The crystal goblets seem to catch more light than before, as though held by invisible hands.

  Then you hear it: the faintest echo of **polite conversation**, the clink of cutlery, and a distant, amused **laugh** that never quite resolves into words."  
- **[DM NOTE]**: If a character calls out, allow a moment.
  - **[SILENCE]** – Let the players respond.
  - Then:
    - **[READ ALOUD]**
      "Whatever was here fades like breath on a mirror. You are alone again with the dust and the empty chairs."

Allow a **DC 13 Wisdom saving throw** from any character focusing on resisting the supernatural unease.
- **On success:** They shake it off; no effect.
- **On failure:** The character is rattled; encourage them to roleplay being on edge. No mechanical penalty.

**[DM PROMPT]** "This house remembers its guests. It might be remembering you already. What do you do?"

---

## 8. Servants’ Hall & Back Areas (Area 7 and Access to Basement)

### 8.1 Moving Toward the Back of the House

Somewhere on this floor there is a plainer, narrower hall for servants, connecting kitchen, pantry, and back stair.

**[READ ALOUD]**
"A narrow **back hallway** stretches away from the kitchen, the walls here plain and unadorned. The rich paneling and tapestries of the front rooms give way to bare, **whitewashed plaster**.

The floorboards creak more loudly underfoot. You see a **simple wooden door** leading down—its steps vanishing into darkness—and another door that likely opens to a small **closet**. A **steep staircase** climbs to the upper floors, clearly meant for servants rather than guests."

**[DM PROMPT]** "Do you explore the door leading down, the closet, or the stairs up?"

### 8.2 The Basement Door – Locked For Now

Per the original adventure, the Death House wants them to explore **upward** first before descending to the dungeon. At this stage, the door to the true basement can be locked or subtly repelling.

**[READ ALOUD – IF THEY TRY THE DOWNWARD DOOR]**
"You try the door that leads downward. The **iron latch** is cold under your fingers.

When you pull, the door barely moves—only a hair, before something in the frame **catches** with a dull thud, like a bolt jammed in place from the other side. It might be **swollen wood**, or something more deliberate."

- **[DM NOTE]**: Decide how strict you want to be:
  - If you want them to clear the upper floors first, the door cannot be opened until the house ‘awakens’ later.
  - If your group is stubborn or experienced, you may allow a **DC 18 Strength (Athletics)** check to break it early, but be ready to run the basement.

- **If they fail to open it:**
  - **[READ ALOUD]**
    "The door shudders under your efforts but refuses to give. A splinter of wood breaks loose and falls at your feet. From the darkness beyond, you hear a single **hollow knock**, as if something below just tapped once on the underside of the stairs."

### 8.3 The Closet

**[READ ALOUD – OPENING THE CLOSET]**
"The small door opens on a **narrow closet** packed with old **cleaning supplies**—a leaning broom, a battered bucket, stiff brushes, and a sack of something that smells sharply of **lye**.

A single, headless **mop** slumps in the corner, its wooden handle propped against the wall like a broken spear."

**Likely Actions:**

1. **Player:** "Any useful supplies?"
   - **[READ ALOUD]**
     "Most of it is worthless unless you plan on scrubbing floors, but you could make do with a few things."  
   - **Loot:**
     - A coil of thin hemp rope (20 feet, **1 gp**).
     - A small sack of lye (can be used to clean, or improvised as a minor irritant—DM’s call).

2. **Player:** "Any hidden compartments?"
   - **[DM NOTE]**: Usually no, but you may hide a small personal touch.
   - **Optional Detail:**
     - **[READ ALOUD]**
       "Tacked to the inside of the door is a **faded scrap of parchment** with a simple note in careful handwriting: ‘Make sure the **children’s rooms** are aired before supper. – E.D.’"  
     - **[DM NOTE]**: ‘E.D.’ stands for **Elizabeth Durst**, foreshadowing the children’s rooms upstairs.

### 8.4 The Servants’ Stair Up

**[READ ALOUD]**
"The narrow servants’ staircase is steep, the treads worn in the middle from years of hurried feet. The air here feels slightly **cooler**, and you notice a faint smell of **stale soap** and **linen**.

As you look up the stairwell, the shadows between the steps seem a little too deep, a little too eager to swallow your gaze."

**[DM PROMPT]** "Do you lead the way up, or explore elsewhere on this floor first?"

Allow them to choose freely. If they go up, you will transition into the second‑floor script (to be detailed in another file).

## 9. Ground Floor Summary for the DM

Use this section to quickly remind yourself of the key beats when running this floor.

1. **Establish Tone** – The house is quiet, watchful, and almost polite. No combat yet.
2. **Foyer & Main Hall** –
   - Read the entry text.
   - Let them investigate the fireplace, carvings, and longsword.
3. **Den of Wolves** –
   - Emphasize predator/prey imagery.
   - Offer wine, crystal glasses, and minor optional loot.
   - Use the **Watching Eyes** optional scare.
4. **Kitchen & Pantry** –
   - Show mundane domestic horror: old food, rust water, ruined meals.
   - A few useful tools and minor consumables (knives, jars, tea, wine).
5. **Dining Room** –
   - Opulent but dusty; heavy foreshadowing (windmills, castle in tapestry).
   - Valuable silver/china/crystal loot.
