# 1. Death House Basement and Ritual Chamber – Part 1

> This file continues directly from `07-Death-House-Attic-and-Nursery.md`. The characters have just discovered the hidden staircase descending from the attic, or otherwise found their way into the basement of Death House.

---

## 1.1 Dungeon Master Overview

**Intended level:** Characters are likely level 2 (possibly 3 if you have awarded extra XP). The basement is deadly. Emphasize horror, dread, and the feeling of being watched.

**Lore fidelity:** This section is based on Appendix B: Death House of *Curse of Strahd*. The names of rooms, cult, and Strahd-worshiping family are preserved. The tone is bleak, oppressive, and tragic.

**What this part covers:**

1. Entering the basement from the secret stair.
2. Initial dungeon corridors and ambience.
3. The family crypts area.
4. First encounters with simple undead/cult flavor.
5. Heavy roleplay prompts and foreshadowing of the final ritual chamber.

You will run this file before moving to **Part 2**, which will handle the deeper hallways, dangerous traps, relics, and finally the Ritual Chamber and shambling mound.

---

## 2. Global Basement Guidance

### 2.1 How to Portray the Basement

**Voice and mood:**

- Speak **low and slow**, as if you were in a library or tomb where loudness feels wrong.
- Frequently pause for silence. Let players talk into the emptiness.
- Use descriptive phrases involving **damp, cold, and echoing stone**.
- When whispering echoes or unseen movement is mentioned, lower your voice and lean towards the players.

**Acting notes:**

- Occasionally glance at corners of the room as if you heard something they did not.
- When they mention Strahd or the house, allow a faint smile or shiver to cross your face.
- When describing bones or crypts, gesture with small, precise hand movements, as if afraid to disturb the dead.

**Soundscape description you can repeat in variations:**

> A cold, earthy smell seeps from the darkness ahead. The staircase groans under your weight, but the sound is quickly swallowed by the heavy silence below. Somewhere far off, you think you hear the faint drip of water. Or is it something else?

Whenever there is a lull, you can reuse or vary that sensory description, emphasizing **smell of damp earth**, **cold stone underfoot**, and **stale air** that makes breathing feel like an effort.

---

## 3. Entering the Basement

### 3.1 Read-Aloud: The Descent

Use this narration as the characters commit to the attic staircase that leads down into the depths.

> The hidden staircase creaks as you begin your descent. Each step down takes you further from the weak, gray light of the attic and deeper into a throat of darkness. The air grows colder and heavier, carrying the smells of damp soil and something else… old rot and the faintest trace of rusted metal.
>
> Your footsteps echo in the tight shaft. After what feels like far too long, the wood of the staircase gives way beneath your boots to rough-hewn stone. The temperature drops sharply; a chill crawls up your legs. Ahead of you stretches a narrow tunnel of packed earth, its ceiling supported by rough timbers blackened with age.
>
> All around, you hear… nothing. No wind, no birds, no sounds from the house above. Only your own breathing—and the occasional soft pat of loose dirt falling from the ceiling.

**Silence Prompt:**

After finishing the above, **look around the table** and say nothing for 5–10 seconds. Let them react.

Then ask in a calm tone:

> "What do you do?"

### 3.2 Likely Player Reactions and DM Responses

**If they ask about light:**

- **Player:** "How dark is it down here? Do we need a light?"
- **DM Response (Neutral, informative):**

  > Down here, it is completely dark. Without a light source, you can only feel the walls and hear your own steps. Those of you with darkvision can see in shades of gray out to about sixty feet, but the tunnel beyond is a maze of earth and shadow.

- **If they light a torch or cast light:** describe flickering shadows.

  > The sudden bloom of light paints the earthen walls in sickly oranges and yellows. The shadows of your bodies stretch long and distorted along the tunnel, bending as the flame gutters in the stagnant air.

**If they hesitate or want to go back up:**

- **Player:** "This feels wrong. Can we go back up to the attic?"
- **DM Response (Gently nudging forward, but allowing choice):**

  > You turn and look up the narrow shaft. The staircase behind you climbs into blackness. You can go back, if you wish—but the sense of being watched does not fade. The house groans faintly somewhere above, like an old beast shifting in its sleep.
  >
  > For a moment, the air behind you feels warmer, as if the house is breathing down your neck.

  Then: **"Do you continue up, or press deeper into the tunnels?"**

If they return, use the upper-house material; otherwise, proceed.

**If they check for tracks or signs:**

- **Call for a Wisdom (Survival) check.**
  - DC 10: They see multiple **small, barefoot human tracks** (children) and larger booted prints in the dust.
  - DC 15: In addition, they notice **drag marks**, as if small bodies were pulled through the dirt, and **scrapes on the timbers** like claws.

- **DM Narration on success:**

  > In the thin layer of dust covering the packed earth, you see prints—small, bare footprints of children, almost entirely overlapped by heavier boot prints. Here and there, long grooves mar the ground, as though something—or someone—was dragged along the tunnel. On one of the timber supports, you spot deep scratches, too irregular to be a tool mark.

Then ask:

> "Knowing that, what do you do?"

---

## 4. Dungeon Layout Primer (For You, Not Read-Aloud)

**Important:** The exact map and measurements are in *Curse of Strahd: Death House*. Keep that map at hand. This guide assumes you know **which tunnel leads where**, but it provides **scene-by-scene narration and dialogue**.

In Part 1, you will cover:

1. **Main Earthen Tunnel** at the base of the stairs.
2. **Four-Way Junction** (central intersection of the basement).
3. **Family Crypt Hall** (crypts of the Durst family).
4. Optional **side niches** and minor creepy details.

You will **not yet** resolve the final ritual chamber or shambling mound; that will be Part 2.

---

## 5. Reaching the Four-Way Junction

### 5.1 Read-Aloud: First Tunnel Section

> The tunnel ahead is just high enough for a human to walk without stooping, its ceiling braced by rough beams every few feet. The walls are damp earth, clawed and pitted, and the floor is uneven stone and packed dirt. Your footsteps make soft thuds and crunches, and each sound seems too loud in the still air.
>
> After perhaps thirty feet, the tunnel bends and opens onto a small junction where other corridors branch off into the darkness, like the roots of a dead tree.

Describe the **four-way intersection** in your own words, but use this as a base:

> You come to a low, open space where four tunnels meet. Wooden beams frame each opening. Cold, stale air breathes from all directions, and you catch the faintest echoes of distant chanting—but you can't make out the words.

### 5.2 Silence and Player Direction

Give them a moment to orient.

**Silence Prompt:** Look at the players and let 5 seconds pass.

Then quietly ask:

> "Where do you go?"  
> (Let them ask questions about each tunnel.)

### 5.3 Answering Questions About Each Direction

Use the original Death House map to know which corridor leads where. At this junction, roughly:

- One tunnel leads toward **family crypts**.
- One leads toward **sleeping quarters and prison cells** (later, Part 2).
- One leads deeper toward the **ritual area** (later, Part 2).
- One returns toward the **stair**.

You can differentiate them by subtle sensory cues (all within lore):

- **Toward the crypts:** Smell of **dry dust and bone**, a sense of stillness.
- **Toward cells/quartets:** Faint smell of **rotting straw and rust**.
- **Toward ritual area:** Slight echo of **distant, rhythmic chanting**.

When players ask "What do we hear from each?":

> From the tunnel facing what you think is north, you hear only your own breathing and the faint creak of timber—heavy stillness, and a dry, dusty smell.
>
> From another tunnel, an iron tang touches your tongue, like old blood or rusted chains, mixed with the sour scent of rotting straw.
>
> From a third, you can just barely make out something else: a low, rhythmic murmur, too distant to understand… like voices chanting in another room.

Let them choose. This file assumes they explore **the family crypts** early, but if they go elsewhere, you can still use those scenes later.

---

## 6. Family Crypts – Approach

### 6.1 Read-Aloud: Approaching the Crypt Hall

When the players choose the crypts tunnel:

> You follow the tunnel toward the dry, still air. The passage narrows slightly, and the ceiling dips just enough that the tallest among you must lower their head. After thirty or forty feet, the tunnel opens into a broader hall.
>
> On either side, set into the earthen walls, are small arched alcoves faced with rough stone. Each alcove is just large enough for a human-sized coffin, though most are empty or filled with rubble and bones. The air here is utterly still, heavy with dust. You can taste it on your tongue.

**Acting Note:** As you describe the dust, **cough softly** or clear your throat.

Then, zoom in to the **Durst family crypts**, which should have stone slabs carved with names.

> Ahead, you see four stone-framed recesses, each sealed by a heavy stone slab. Crudely carved into the slabs are names:
>
> - **Gustav Durst**  
> - **Elisabeth Durst**  
> - **Rosavalda Durst**  
> - **Thornboldt Durst**
>
> The carvings are stiff and uneven, yet the names are clear despite the dust.

Pause and then:

> "What do you do?"

### 6.2 Likely Player Actions and DM Responses

**If they recognize the children’s names (from earlier):**

- **Player:** "Wait… Rosavalda and Thornboldt? Those are Rose and Thorn, right?"
- **DM Response (Somber):**

  > Yes. These slabs bear the full names of the children you met above. The thought of them makes the air feel even colder down here.

- **Optional Creepy Add-On (if the children’s spirits are with them or nearby):**

  If you are having the children follow them as ghosts or as haunting presences, you can add:

  > For a heartbeat, you feel a presence at your elbow, as though a small hand is trying to slip into yours. If you look down, there is nothing there—but the sense of being watched from child-height lingers.

**If they ask about disturbing the slabs:**

- **Player:** "Can we open these crypts?"

- **DM (Neutral, with warning tone):**

  > The slabs are heavy, but not impossible to move. It will take some effort and make some noise, and whatever rests inside has been undisturbed for a long time.
  >
  > Are you opening one? If so, which name?

Ask specifically which slab. This keeps the focus personal.

## 7. The Children’s Remains and Their Crypts

In the official Death House, the children’s remains can be placed here. This guide assumes that **the children’s actual remains are currently in the attic** and may be brought here, or else already placed here depending on how you’ve handled things above.

### 7.1 If the Children’s Bodies Are Still in the Attic

If the party has not disturbed or moved the bones in the attic yet, the crypts of **Rosavalda** and **Thornboldt** are **empty** but dusty.

**Read-Aloud when opening an empty child’s crypt:**

> With a heavy grating sound, the stone slab slides aside, sending a small cloud of dust into the air. Inside is a short, stone recess just large enough for a child’s coffin—but it is empty. A thin layer of gray dust carpets the floor, and in one corner, a tiny spider has built its web.

**Emotional Prompt:**

> The emptiness feels wrong… like a promise that was never kept.

Then ask:

> "Seeing that, what do you do?"

**Likely Responses:**

- **Player:** "This is messed up. Why are their graves empty?"
- **DM:**

  > The question hangs in the stale air, unanswered. Only your own voice, echoing faintly, replies.

**Optional Lore Hint:** You can remind them of the **attic nursery**:

> Your mind goes back to the locked nursery upstairs, the tiny skeletons in the corner of the room, and the dolls arranged as though waiting for children who never came home.

### 7.2 If the Children’s Bodies Have Been Collected by the Party

If the party has respectfully gathered the children’s bones with the intent to lay them to rest, this is a powerful scene.

**Prompt:**

> If you wish, you can place Rosavalda and Thornboldt’s remains here, where their names are carved.

If the players do so, lean into it heavily.

**Read-Aloud: Laying the Children to Rest**

> You carefully place the small, fragile bones into the empty crypts, arranging them as best you can. Dust clings to your fingers, and the bones feel unnaturally cold, as though they have been starved of warmth for years.
>
> When the last bone is laid down and you step back, a hush falls—deeper than before, as if the very earth is holding its breath. For a moment, the flicker of your torch dims, and a gentle, phantom breeze stirs the dust.
>
> Those of you most sensitive to the supernatural feel a presence lighten, as if two tiny weights have been lifted from your shoulders.

**If the children’s ghosts are still with them, this is a great passing-on moment.**

**Ghost Farewell Dialogue (Optional, Very On-Theme):**

Voice the children **softly, with a slight echo**.

- **Rosavalda (Rose) – Voice Notes:** Slightly bossy but tired, like a girl who had to grow up too fast. Speak clearly, carefully.
- **Thornboldt (Thorn) – Voice Notes:** Quiet, hesitant, stuttering sometimes when scared.

**Rose’s Final Words:**

> *"Th-thank you,"* a small, breathy voice says near your ear. *"We were so cold… for so long. We didn’t think anyone would find us."*

**Thorn’s Final Words:**

> Another whisper follows, trembling but grateful. *"C-can we… sleep now, Rose?"*
>
> *"Yes, Thorn,"* comes the answer, fading. *"We can sleep now. Thank you."*

Then:

> The chill in the air eases—just a little. The sense of being watched by small, desperate eyes fades like breath on glass.

**Mechanical Benefit (Optional, but Recommended):**

- You may grant the party **Inspiration** to one or more characters for this act of compassion.
- Alternatively, you can grant a one-time **+1 bonus on a single saving throw** against fear or charm within Death House.

Say quietly:

> "Each of you who took part in laying the children to rest gains Inspiration."  
> (If you use Inspiration.)

### 7.3 The Parents’ Crypts (Gustav and Elisabeth)

When a player opens **Gustav** or **Elisabeth** Durst’s crypts, they contain **simple remains**—the actual text describes skeletons in their burial niches.

**Read-Aloud – Opening a Parent’s Crypt:**

> With a grinding moan of stone on stone, the slab moves aside. Inside, on a rough stone ledge, lies a human skeleton wrapped in rotted, colorless cloth. The bones are brittle-looking and yellowed with age. Empty eye sockets stare up at you from a skull tilted slightly to one side, as though in faint curiosity.

**If they disturb the bodies:**

- There is **no immediate attack** in canon from these crypts, but you can describe unsettling sensations.

> As you brush against the bones, they shift with a dry rattle. For a brief second, you feel as though something inside the skull is watching you—a memory, a curse, or the faint echo of a life badly lived.

Ask:

> "Are you taking anything from the crypt, or leaving it as is?"

**Loot Possibilities (Minor, Lore-Friendly):**

The official module doesn’t place major treasure here, but you can add **flavorful, low-impact items**:

- **A tarnished silver wedding band** (value 10 gp) on Gustav’s bony finger.
- **A cracked pearl pendant** (value 20 gp) on Elisabeth’s neck.

If a player searches the remains carefully (call for an **Investigation check**, DC 12):

> Rooting through the tangled, rotted cloth, you find a small token of the life this person once had: [wedding band / cracked pendant]. The metal is cold, and dust cakes the inside of the band.

Ask the looting character directly:

> "Do you take it?"

If they do, this is a good moment for **moral tension** and **Strahd’s attention** (optional minor interaction).

---

## 8. Optional Strahd Attention – The Watching Eyes

When the party **loots the parents’ crypts** or otherwise disrespects the dead, you may insert a very brief, non-combat Strahd scene. He does not appear physically; he observes.

### 8.1 Narration – Cold Attention

> As your fingers close around the stolen trinket, the air in the crypt drops a few more degrees. Your breath fogs in front of your lips, and a faint, metallic taste—like old blood—fills your mouth.
>
> For a heartbeat, the shadows in the corners of the ceiling deepen, pooling like ink. You feel eyes on the back of your neck—ancient, amused, and utterly without pity.

**Acting Note:** As DM, **look directly at the looting player**, unblinking, for a few seconds.

Then say, as a disembodied, velvety male voice (Strahd):

> *"How touching,"* a smooth, accented voice whispers in your mind—a voice none of you have heard before. *"In my land, even the dead are not spared from hunger."*
>
> The voice chuckles, low and bitter. *"Take what you will. In the end, all things you own—all things you are—belong to me."*

Then the sensation fades.

**Mechanical Effect (Optional):**

- No immediate change, but you may **mark** the looting character as “noticed by Strahd.” This can influence later scenes.

**Closed Prompt:**

> "Do you say anything in response to the voice, or keep it to yourself?"

If the player speaks aloud, other characters hear them; if they keep silent, only that player knows of the event (though you as DM can encourage secrets).

---

## 9. Ambient Details Around the Crypt Hall

Before the party leaves this area, give them a chance to **search more thoroughly**, discover **minor horrors**, and feel the oppressive atmosphere.

### 9.1 Searching the Hall – Skill Checks

If they say "We search the area," or similar, ask:

> "Are you just giving it a quick look as you pass, or are you spending several minutes searching carefully?"

If **quick look**: Call for **Perception, DC 10**.

- Success: They notice small bones, bits of decayed grave goods, and spider webs.

If **careful search** (taking time): Call for **Investigation, DC 12**.

- Success: They find:
  - **Minor trinkets**: An old holy symbol of a forgotten god (no active magic), a string of wooden prayer beads, a child’s cracked toy soldier missing an arm.
  - **Bone fragments** that don’t match any of the marked crypts (hinting at other victims).

**Narration for a Successful Thorough Search:**

> You spend several minutes combing through the alcoves and piles of old bones. Mixed among the remains, you find a few small, personal objects: a splintered wooden holy symbol with no god you recognize, a string of beads polished smooth by fingers long turned to dust, and a tiny wooden toy soldier with one arm snapped off.
>
> None of these things have any obvious use or magic—but they reek of stories cut short.

Ask:

> "Do you take any of these, or leave them here?"

If they leave them, note the **respect**. If they take them, more **ominous Strahd attention** is possible later.

### 9.2 Subtle Hauntings (Atmosphere, No Damage)

At any point here, especially if things slow down, you can add one of the following:

- A **soft child’s giggle** echoing faintly, then cutting off.
- A **gust of cold air** that extinguishes a candle or makes a torch gutter.
- The sound of **stone scraping on stone** in the distance.

Describe one:

> As you move between the alcoves, a sudden chill scrapes along your spine. One of your torches flickers violently, its flame stretching sideways before snapping back. For just a moment, you think you hear the faint echo of a child’s laughter… but when you stop and listen, there is only silence.

Then, again:

> "What do you do?"

---

## 10. Exiting the Crypts – Choosing the Next Path

Once the players feel they have finished here, they will likely return to the **four-way junction**.

### 10.1 Read-Aloud: Back to the Junction

> You leave the crypts behind, the names on the slabs fading into the gloom behind you. The tunnel narrows again, and the scent of dust gives way once more to the heavier, earthier smell of the main passage.
>
> Within a minute, you emerge back at the four-way intersection, where cold air breathes from multiple tunnels and the distant, rhythmic chanting tickles the edge of your hearing.

**Prompt:**

> "You stand again at the crossing of tunnels: one smells of old straw and rust, another hums with faint, distant chanting. Where do you go now?"

This is the transition point to the **next section of the basement**, which will be detailed in **`08-Death-House-Basement-and-Ritual-Chamber-Part-2.md`**.

---

## 11. Saving Throws, Encounters, and Mechanics in This Part

### 11.1 Saving Throws

In this Part 1 section, there are **no required combat encounters** per the base module in the crypt area. However, you may introduce:

- **Wisdom Saving Throws against fear (DC 10–12)** when they experience intense hauntings or Strahd’s mental touch, especially for very nervous players.

**Example:**

> As the voice of Strahd coils through your mind, a wave of unnatural dread washes over you. Make a **Wisdom saving throw, DC 12**.

On **success**:

> Your heart hammers in your chest, but you force yourself to breathe, gripping your weapon or holy symbol until your knuckles go white. The fear recedes, leaving only a shaking tension behind.

On **failure** (flavor only, or impose **disadvantage on the next attack roll or ability check**):

> Your hands tremble, and your breath comes short and shallow. For a few seconds, you can’t shake the feeling that someone is standing directly behind you, icy hands poised to close around your throat. Even when the sensation fades, your pulse refuses to slow.

### 11.2 Encounters

By default, **no mandatory monsters** attack in this early crypt section. That said, if the party is very confident or you need to maintain tension, you can add a minor, lore-consistent encounter.

**Optional Encounter: Stirges in the Crypt Hall**

- **Number:** 1–4 stirges, depending on party size.
- **Reason:** Attracted by movement and the warmth of living blood.

**Battlefield Layout:**

- Narrow corridor with alcoves on either side.
- Stirges emerge from cracks in the ceiling above the crypts.
- Limited maneuvering; ranged characters can still shoot.

**Read-Aloud – Stirges Attack (Optional):**

> As you move between the crypts, a faint chittering sound whispers from the darkness overhead. Before you can react, small, leathery shapes detach from the ceiling—bloated, bat-like creatures with needle-like proboscises.
>
> They swoop down, drawn to the warmth of your blood.

Then say:

> "Roll initiative."

**Mechanical Notes:** Use the stirge stat block from the *Monster Manual* or from the *Curse of Strahd* appendix if provided.

### 11.3 Loot Summary for This Part

- **Gustav’s Crypt (Optional):** Tarnished silver wedding band, 10 gp.
- **Elisabeth’s Crypt (Optional):** Cracked pearl pendant, 20 gp.
- **Minor Trinkets (Optional, No GP Value):** Holy symbol, prayer beads, toy soldier.
- **Spiritual Reward:** Inspiration or minor one-time saving throw bonus for laying the children to rest.

Clearly tell the players the approximate value for easily sellable items once they examine them:

> A character familiar with trade goods or jewelry would estimate the silver band at about **10 gold pieces**, and the cracked pearl pendant at about **20 gold pieces**, if they can find anyone in Barovia willing and able to buy.

---

## 12. Campaign Triggers in This Part

- **If the children’s remains are laid to rest in their crypts:**
  - Mark on your notes: *"Rose & Thorn laid to rest – spirits passed on."*
  - If they were haunting or possessing anyone, that influence weakens or ends according to your previous scenes.
  - You may make Death House **slightly less hostile** in tone—fewer aggressive hauntings.

- **If players loot the Durst parents’ graves disrespectfully:**
  - Mark the character as **"Noticed by Strahd (Grave Robber)"*.
  - Future Strahd interactions can reference this: he may mock them for it later.

- **If any Tarokka card related to family, innocence, or sacrifice** has been drawn earlier in your larger campaign (if you’re running Tarokka very early; optional):
  - You may tie this scene to that card in flavor only—for example, mentioning that the **Seer** or **Innocent** card foreshadowed the children.

---

## 13. Closing This Part

When you are ready to move on, end this file with a firm transition:

> You stand once more at the crossing of tunnels beneath Death House. The names of the Durst family rest behind you in silent stone, and ahead, the distant chanting grows a little clearer with each breath.
>
> Whatever waits in the depths of this place is drawing you on.

**Say:**

> "We will continue deeper into the basement—the prison cells, the cult’s quarters, and finally the ritual chamber—in the next section of your notes: `08-Death-House-Basement-and-Ritual-Chamber-Part-2.md`. For now, decide which tunnel you will take next."
