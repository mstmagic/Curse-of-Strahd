# 6. Death House – Interior Upper Floors, Part 2

> This file continues directly from **05-Death-House-Interior-Upper-Floors-Part-1.md**. Run that file first.

## 1. Scene Overview

1. You are still inside the Durst family townhouse, on the **third and fourth floors**, leading toward the hidden attic and, eventually, the basement.
2. Tone: oppressive, dusty, strangely preserved, like a home frozen in the moment of a nightmare.
3. Level range: Characters are likely **level 2–3** by the end of Death House.

This part focuses on:

- Finishing the **third floor** (if not yet complete).
- The **attic**, including the **children’s room** and their **spirits**.
- The **secret door** to the **stairs that descend to the basement** (handled in the next file).

Throughout, stay slow, descriptive, and give players many chances to talk, investigate, and roleplay.

---

## 2. Re‑Entering the Third Floor Corridor

> Use this if you are resuming from a previous session or transitioning from Part 1.

### 2.1 Narration: Third‑Floor Stillness

Read aloud:

> The staircase groans beneath your weight as you climb back to the third floor. Dust hangs in the air like fine gray snow, disturbed by every step. The wallpaper here is peeling in long curls, exposing dark, swollen wood beneath. Oil lamps in tarnished brass brackets cling to the walls, unlit and sticky to the touch with age.
>
> The house is very, very quiet. Too quiet. You can hear your own breathing—too loud. Your boot scuffs—too loud. Somewhere, wood pops and settles with a tired, aching creak, like the house is sighing in its sleep.

Pause. Look at the players silently for 5–10 seconds.

**Silence Prompt:**
- Say nothing. Let them decide what they do.

### 2.2 Acting Notes – The House Itself

- Treat the **house as a character**: resentful, watchful, amused.
- When describing random creaks or movements, lower your voice, slow your pace, and keep your tone flat, like the house is indifferent to their fear.
- Occasionally glance at the ceiling or a corner of the room mid‑sentence, as if you heard something they didn’t, but then dismiss it.

**Prompt:**
- "What do you do?"

Likely player actions:

1. **"I listen for anything unusual."**
   - DM response (soft, careful):
     > You hold your breath and listen. The only sounds are the whisper of your own breathing and the faint tick of wood shifting in the walls. No footsteps. No voices. Just the quiet, patient weight of the house itself.
   - If they succeed on a **Wisdom (Perception) DC 12**:
     > For a moment, you think you hear something—like a child’s laugh—far above you. Then it’s gone.

2. **"I call out: ‘Hello? Anyone there?’"**
   - DM, answering as the house (no real reply):
     > Your voice travels down the corridor and dies somewhere in the shadows. No one answers.

3. **"I check the nearest doors again."**
   - Direct them to remaining unexplored rooms or remind them what they’ve seen.

---

## 3. Transition to the Attic Stairs

Once the group has explored the third floor’s main rooms (see Part 1), guide them toward the **concealed door** that leads up to the **attic stair**.

### 3.1 Finding the Secret Door

There is a **secret door** on this floor that leads to the attic staircase. If the players have not yet discovered it, use investigation prompts.

**Narration if they’re searching the halls or walls:**

> As you move along the wall, running your hand over the cracked paper and dry wood, your fingers catch on a thin seam—too straight, too deliberate to be an accident. There is a faint outline of a door hidden in the paneling, almost invisible under the stained wallpaper.

**Check:**
- **Intelligence (Investigation) DC 13** to find the seam if they describe searching.
- A character **tapping** the walls can also find it with **DC 13 Wisdom (Perception)**.

If they **fail**:

> Your searching turns up nothing certain—just warped wood and peeling paper. The house keeps its secrets, for now.

**Prompt:**
- "What else do you do? Where do you search next?"

Let them try again later with advantage if they get creative.

### 3.2 Opening the Secret Door

When they succeed:

> With a muted crack of dried glue and old paper, the hidden door pulls away from the wall. A gust of air exudes from the darkness beyond—stale and incredibly cold, carrying the smell of dust, mildew, and something faintly sour, like long‑spoiled food.
>
> Beyond the door, a narrow wooden staircase rises into blackness.

**Silence Prompt:**
- Look up, as if toward the dark stairwell. Say nothing for a long beat. Let them feel the weight of choosing to go up.

**Likely responses:**

1. **"I look up with a light."**
   - DM response:
     > Your light crawls up the narrow stairs, licking across railings chewed by time and rot. Cobwebs hang in thick sheets from the low ceiling, stirring slightly in a breath of air that seems to come from nowhere. The stairs vanish into a square of darkness above.

2. **"I listen for anything from upstairs."**
   - Call for a **Wisdom (Perception) DC 12**.
   - On success:
     > Somewhere above, you hear a slow, rhythmic sound. It might be something brushing against wood. It might be the steady flap of a tattered curtain. Or… it might be breathing.
   - On failure:
     > You strain to listen, but the silence presses in on your ears until it almost hums. If something is up there, it’s very, very quiet.

3. **"I don’t trust it—we look for another way."**
   - Calmly confirm there are no other visible stairways going further up (unless they missed something important from earlier, in which case refer back).
   - DM line:
     > As far as you can tell, this is the only way to go higher in the house.

**Prompt to move on:**
- "Who goes first up the stairs, and how are you moving—quietly, quickly, weapons drawn?"

Encourage them to state marching order and style.

---

## 4. The Attic Staircase

### 4.1 Narration: Climbing to the Attic

Read aloud slowly:

> The staircase is narrow—barely wide enough for a single person at a time. Each step complains beneath your weight with a long, dry creak that sounds much too loud in the confined space.
>
> The air grows colder as you climb. Your breath mists faintly in front of you. Cobwebs cling to your face and armor like sticky veil, and the smell of dust becomes almost choking—thick with the taste of old wood, old cloth, and the faint, metallic tang of something that might be rust.
>
> Your light strokes the top of the stairs and you see a low ceiling above, with wooden beams coated in gray filth. Beyond, the stairwell opens into a long, dark hall.

Pause.

**Prompt:**
- "You reach the top of the stairs. What do you do as you step into the attic?"

### 4.2 Attic Landing Description

> You emerge onto a cramped attic landing. The ceiling slopes down to either side, forcing the taller among you to duck in places. The walls and floor are bare wood, scuffed and scarred and deeply stained with long, thin dark marks.
>
> Dust lies thick here, undisturbed for years. Your footsteps leave sharp, clear prints. Webs blur the corners of the ceiling, sagging between beams like gray curtains.
>
> A row of closed wooden doors lines one wall—plain, unadorned, and swollen with age. Each has a simple iron latch. A lone oil lamp, cold and empty, hangs from a nail, gently swaying in a draft you can’t quite feel.

**Atmosphere/Acting Notes:**
- Lower your voice and speak slowly.
- Occasionally cough lightly or clear your throat, as if the dust is affecting you, to reinforce the sensory detail.

**Prompt:**
- "There are several doors up here. Which do you approach first, and how?"

Encourage them to specify tactics: weapons out, stealth, listening first, etc.

---

## 5. Attic Hall – General Mechanics

You can use this generic interaction pattern for any door on the attic level before the specific keyed rooms.

### 5.1 Listening at Doors

If a player says they listen at a door:
- Call for a **Wisdom (Perception) check, DC 10**.
- On success: give minor ambient sounds (mice skittering, cloth rustling, faint wind).
- On failure: total silence.

Sample DM lines:

- Success:
  > You press your ear to the cold wood. You hear the faint, restless scurrying of something small—rodents, maybe—inside, along with the creak of boards adjusting to the night. Nothing larger, nothing… deliberate.

- Failure:
  > The wood is thick and deadened with age. If there are sounds inside, they’re swallowed before they reach you.

### 5.2 Opening a Door

Ask:
- "Do you open it slowly and quietly, or do you push it open normally?"

If they open **slowly/quietly**, no roll is necessary unless something is explicitly lurking.

If they **kick it in or rush**:
- Describe a burst of dust and noise, but only call for rolls when it matters (e.g., surprising a creature—which isn’t common here until later).

---

## 6. Attic Storage Rooms (Non‑Children’s Rooms)

These are mostly flavor and tension, but you should play them up to build dread.

### 6.1 Storage Room Description

For a generic attic storage room:

> The door groans open, releasing a cloud of stale dust. Inside, the room is crowded with lifeless shapes swaddled in drab, moth‑eaten sheets. As your light sweeps across the space, these shapes become furniture—chairs, tables, a tall wardrobe—all cocooned in gray cloth like corpses awaiting burial.
>
> An old coat rack leans in the corner, its hooks like skeletal fingers. A cracked mirror, its surface fogged and spotted with age, leans against the far wall, reflecting your light in a warped blur.
>
> The smell of dry wood and trapped air fills your nose, along with the faint stink of something long dead—rodents, perhaps.

**Acting notes:**
- When the players first see sheets over furniture, slow down and let them think they might be bodies.
- Then reveal they’re just furniture—but emphasize that the fear is real and the house is feeding on it.

**Prompt:**
- "What do you do in this room? Do you search, move the sheets, check the furniture, or just leave?"

### 6.2 Investigation and Loot in Storage

If the players **search carefully**:
- Call for **Intelligence (Investigation) DC 12** or **Wisdom (Perception) DC 12**.

On success, they can find small, low‑value items for immersion:

- A cracked porcelain doll with one glass eye missing.
- A wooden hobby horse with a real horse’s tail, stiff with age.
- A bundle of moldy linens.
- A locked, empty strongbox (no key in this room).

You can give 1–3 of these, as flavor only.

If you want to reward them materially (optional, minor):
- **Loot:** A small wooden jewelry box containing:
  - 3 silver rings (25 gp each).
  - 1 gold locket with nothing inside (50 gp).

**Prices:**
- These items can be sold later in Barovia or Vallaki, but merchants there are suspicious and pay **half value at best**.

DM line:
> These might be worth something to a jeweler or collector, though good luck finding a friendly one in a place like this.

**Prompt:**
- "Do you take these items, leave them, or do something else with them?"

Let them wrestle with morality and possible curses if they’re paranoid.

---

## 7. The Children’s Room (Rose and Thorn)

This is the **critical scene of the attic**. The Durst children’s spirits remain here, and this is the emotional center of Death House before the descent.

### 7.1 Approaching the Door

Describe the door to the children’s room more specifically than the others.

> One of the attic doors looks different from the rest. Its surface is carved with faint, faded designs—once playful, now worn almost smooth by time. Little floral patterns, a tiny carved sun, a moon with a smiling face. The iron latch is small, as if meant for smaller hands.

**Prompt:**
- "Do you approach this door? Do you knock, listen, or open it?"

If someone **listens**:
- Call for **Wisdom (Perception) DC 11**.
- On success:
  > You hear the soft creak of wood and the faint, rhythmic thump of something slowly hitting the floor, then rising, then falling again. It might be a toy. Or something rocking.
- On failure:
  > You don’t hear anything except your own breathing.

### 7.2 Entering the Room – First Impression

When they open the door:

> The door opens with a long, complaining creak. Inside, the room looks like a child’s bedroom frozen in time.
>
> Two small beds sit against the wall, their once‑bright quilts now faded to lifeless gray‑brown. A tiny dollhouse—an exact miniature of the house you’re in—rests on a low table near the window. Its little shutters are closed, its miniature front door standing slightly ajar.
>
> Toys are scattered across a threadbare rug: carved wooden soldiers, a blunt toy sword, a little spinning top. A small wardrobe leans in the corner, its door hanging open on one hinge.
>
> The air here is different from the rest of the house—stale, yes, but also… still. Heavy with something like sadness. You can almost taste salt on your tongue, like old tears.

Pause for a moment. Let them react.

**Prompt:**
- "What do you do as you step into the children’s room?"

### 7.3 Rose and Thorn – Spirit Introduction

If you are following the book, the **spirits of Rose and Thorn** may already have appeared earlier outside. For this campaign, treat this room as their **anchor**. They can manifest here whether or not the characters met them before.

**Appearance and Mannerisms**

- **Rose (Rosavalda Durst)**
  - Age: about 10.
  - Voice: Slightly nasal, prim, trying very hard to sound like an adult. Speak clearly, a bit fast, and with a clipped, proper tone.
  - Personality: Bossy, protective of her brother, rules‑oriented, anxious beneath her composure.
  - Body language (if you want to describe): She stands very straight, hands folded in front of her or clutching a doll.

- **Thorn (Thornboldt Durst)**
  - Age: about 7.
  - Voice: Small, shaky, timid. Tremble slightly as you speak. Occasionally sniffle.
  - Personality: Frightened, clingy, dependent on Rose, easily upset.

**Narration – The Spirits Appear**

As the characters explore the room, choose a moment where someone:
- Approaches the dollhouse,
- Investigates a bed,
- Or steps fully inside and closes the door.

Then read:

> As your attention settles on the little dollhouse, the air in the room seems to thicken. For a heartbeat, the dust motes in the air slow, hanging almost motionless.
>
> Then, two small figures are suddenly there near the far wall.
>
> A girl in a worn but once‑fine dress stands rigidly, looking at you with large, dark eyes. Her hair is neatly brushed and tied with a faded ribbon. A younger boy clings to her skirt with both hands, his face blotchy as if he’d been crying for a very long time.
>
> Their forms are slightly transparent, edges blurred like smoke in still air. But there is no mistaking the pain in their eyes.

Pause for effect. Then slip into character.

### 7.4 NPC Dialogue – First Contact

**Rose’s opening line (prim, controlled):**

> "You… you’re not supposed to be up here. This is our room."  
> She lifts her chin a little. "Who are you? Did our parents send you?"

**Thorn (timid, clutching Rose):**

> "I don’t want to go back downstairs, Rose... it’s scary…"  
> He looks at the party with wide, wet eyes. "Are you going to make us go back down there?"

**Prompt to players:**
- "How do you respond to the children?"

### 7.5 Likely Player Responses and DM Replies

1. **Kind and reassuring response** (e.g. "We’re here to help," "It’s okay," etc.).

   **Rose (suspicious but hopeful):**
   > Rose narrows her eyes, studying you, like she’s deciding if you’re worthy of something important.
   >
   > "Help? How? No one ever comes back after they go down. They all go into the house and it… it doesn’t let them go."  
   > She glances toward the floor, as if she can see through it. "Do you… really think you can help?"

   **Thorn:**
   > "I’m scared…" he whispers. "There’s a monster in the basement. It makes noises. It made everyone go away…"  
   > He squeezes Rose’s dress tighter. "I don’t want to be alone again."

2. **Suspicious/hostile response** ("What are you? Ghosts? What did you do?").

   **Rose (offended, bristling):**
   > She stiffens, her eyes flashing. "We didn’t do anything! This is our house."  
   > Her voice wavers, then hardens. "It’s not our fault the others never came back. Mother and Father said they had important work in the basement. That it was for the good of the family."  
   > She looks away. "They locked us in here. They said it was to keep us safe."  
   > Her transparency flickers slightly, tremoring with anger and hurt.

   **Thorn:**
   > Thorn hides his face against her side, peeking out only enough to watch you nervously.

3. **Direct questioning about the basement/monster**.

   **Rose’s explanation (keep it vague and frightened):**
   > "There’s a… thing in the basement. We could hear it sometimes. It made growling noises. Wet noises." She shudders. "They said it was a ‘gift,’ and that they had to feed it. The servants brought people down there. They never came back."
   >
   > "The door to the basement is hidden. Even we weren’t allowed to go there. But we heard them. We heard them chanting."  
   > Her gaze sharpens on you. "If you’re going to help us, you have to stop it. You have to make it go quiet."

4. **Ignoring the children and just searching the room.**

   - Have Rose react first.

   **Rose (hurt, demanding):**
   > "Excuse me!"  
   > Her voice cracks, an eerie echo along the walls. "You can’t just rummage through our things! They’re ours!"  
   > She hesitates, smaller. "Please… talk to us. Don’t pretend we’re not here. Everyone else… does that. Or they scream."

   - This should gently push the party to roleplay with them.

**Prompt after they speak with the children for a bit:**
- "Do you ask them more questions, try to comfort them, or do you focus on searching the room and the dollhouse?"

---

## 8. Key Information from Rose and Thorn

Use this section as your **reference**, not something you read aloud word‑for‑word. Answer questions naturally in character.

What Rose and Thorn know and can share:

1. **They starved to death locked in this room.**
   - They may not fully realize they are dead, or they struggle to admit it.
   - Rose’s line if pressed:  
     > "They locked the door and didn’t come back. We waited. We were good. We followed the rules. But… no one came. It got cold. We got tired."  
     > Her voice grows tiny. "I remember being so hungry. Then I don’t remember anything else."

2. **There is a monster in the basement.**
   - They heard it and heard chanting.
   - They don’t know exactly *what* it is.

3. **There is a secret way to the basement.**
   - The passage begins in the **attic**, connected to this room’s **closet** or behind the dollhouse (depending on edition layout). In this campaign, make the dollhouse reveal the secret.

4. **Their greatest desire:**
   - For the monster to be stopped and for them not to be alone.
   - They may seek to **possess** a PC if the PCs leave them (rules in the original adventure), but you can foreshadow this by making them clingy and fearful.

**Strahd Connection (Lore‑Accurate Flavor):**
- The Dursts are cultists who worship a dark power ultimately tied to Barovia’s corruption. Strahd is not their direct patron, but the darkness in Barovia nourishes and reflects his domain.
- You can hint at this without naming Strahd yet:

  **Rose line:**
  > "Mother said we had to do what the land’s master wanted, or the mists would never let us go. I don’t know who he is. They never said his name aloud."

This is a **campaign trigger**: the players get their first hint that **there is a ‘master’ of this land**.

---

## 9. The Dollhouse – Discovering the Secret Passage

The miniature dollhouse is a **map of Death House** and reveals the secret staircase down.

### 9.1 Investigating the Dollhouse

If a player says they examine the dollhouse:

> The dollhouse is an exquisite miniature replica of the house you’re in, though coated with dust. Tiny windows, little doors, miniature furniture—someone spent great care crafting this. The tiny front door of the dollhouse stands slightly ajar.

**Check:**
- **Intelligence (Investigation) DC 12** to discover the secret staircase by moving walls/roof.
- If they say something like "I look for secret rooms in the dollhouse," give them **advantage**.

On a **success**:

> As you lift the front of the dollhouse and peer inside, your fingers brush a section of wall that moves when it shouldn’t. Tiny hinges swing open, revealing a miniature secret door and a hidden stairway spiraling down into the dollhouse’s basement.
>
> The hairs on the back of your neck rise. If there’s a hidden door in the dollhouse… there’s likely one in the real house as well.

On **failure**:

> You find rooms that match nearly everything you’ve seen so far, but nothing stands out as a secret way down. The tiny rooms seem strangely lifeless.

Allow them to retry if they get creative (e.g., using magic, methodical room‑by‑room comparison, or help from Rose).

### 9.2 Rose and Thorn React to the Dollhouse

If the players fiddle with the dollhouse:

**Rose (softly):**
> "We weren’t supposed to play with that. It’s important. Mother said it was the ‘key to understanding the house.’"  
> She glances nervously toward the door. "But she’s not here now. I suppose… you can look."

If they discover the secret in the dollhouse and ask where it is in the real house:

**Rose:**
> She leans closer, peering into the miniature. "There. In the attic."  
> She looks around your real surroundings, eyes darting. "So… it must be here. In this room. Or… very close by."

**Prompt:**
- "You now suspect there’s a hidden door or passage nearby, just like in the dollhouse. What do you do? Where do you search?"

### 9.3 Finding the Real Secret Door

The **real secret passage** is usually hidden in the adjacent closet or built into a wall of this room, mirroring the dollhouse.

**Checks to find it:**
- **Intelligence (Investigation) DC 13** while searching walls/closet.
- **Wisdom (Perception) DC 13** if tapping or feeling for drafts.

On success:

> Your fingers catch again on a thin, straight seam in the wood. When you press firmly, the panel releases with a dry pop. A section of wall swings inward, revealing a narrow, steep staircase spiraling down into utter darkness. A breath of air rises from below—clammy, cold, and smelling of wet stone, mold, and old blood.

**Silence Prompt:**
- After reading this, look at the players and say nothing for at least 5 seconds.

Then:
- "The secret stairway yawns before you, waiting. What do you do?"

---

## 10. The Children’s Remains (Optional but Lore‑Accurate)

In this room, the children’s **skeletal remains** are hidden, usually in a small locked chest or behind another panel.

### 10.1 Discovering the Remains

If the players **thoroughly search** the room beyond the dollhouse:

- Call for **Intelligence (Investigation) DC 14**.
- On success:

  > Beneath one of the beds you find a small, battered wooden chest. Its lid is warped, and an old iron lock hangs from the front.

  If they **break or pick the lock** (no high DC needed; **DC 10 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools)** or a few solid hits):

  > The lock snaps, and the lid creaks slowly open. Inside, wrapped in filthy, faded cloth, are the small, jumbled bones of two children.
  >
  > The air seems to grow heavier, pressing down on your shoulders. For a moment, the room feels colder than the rest of the house.

  **Rose and Thorn’s reaction:**
  - They fall silent, staring.

  **Rose (softly):**
  > "Oh."  
  > Her composure cracks; her voice sounds much younger. "That’s… us."  
  > Her hand tightens on Thorn’s shoulder. "They really never came back, did they?"

  **Thorn (sobbing):**
  > "I don’t want to be dead, Rose…"  
  > He buries his face in her dress.

### 10.2 Roleplay Opportunities

Give the players a chance to respond:

**Prompt:**
- "What do you do with the children’s remains? Do you say anything? Do you promise them anything?"

Likely responses and your replies:

1. **They promise to lay the children to rest.**

   **Rose:**
   > She looks at you with wide, wet eyes. "You… you’d do that?"  
   > Her voice is hoarse. "If you lay us to rest… maybe we won’t have to stay here anymore. Maybe we won’t have to be so alone."

2. **They are callous or dismissive.**

   **Rose (hurt, anger under the surface):**
   > Her expression turns cold. "Of course. Why should you care? No one else ever did."  
   > Her outline flickers more violently. "You’re just like them."  
   > She turns away, clutching Thorn protectively.

   - This can foreshadow **possession attempts** later if you choose to use that mechanic (per the book).

3. **They are reverent—saying prayers, covering the bones, etc.**

   - Have the room’s oppressive feeling lessen slightly.

   DM line:
   > As you speak words of respect over the little bones, the air in the room seems to lighten, just a fraction. The cold is still there, but it no longer bites quite as sharply.

**Campaign Trigger:**
- If the party **properly buries the remains later** in Barovia’s graveyard or another sanctified place:
  - Rose and Thorn’s spirits can **move on**, and the house might briefly relent in its hostility toward them (perhaps a saving throw with advantage against a future fear effect while still in Death House).

---

## 11. Optional: Children’s Possession (Rules‑Light Version)

This section is **optional** but follows the tone of Curse of Strahd. Use it if you want to lean into creepiness and roleplay.

### 11.1 Trigger for Possession

If the party attempts to **leave the children alone** in the room, or refuses to help, or tries to go into the basement without any promise or comfort, Rose and Thorn may attempt to **possess** one or two characters.

**Narration:**

> As you move toward the secret stairway, you feel a sudden, icy pressure at the back of your neck—like someone small and desperate has thrown their arms around you from behind.
>
> The temperature drops sharply. Your breath fogs in the air. Behind you, Rose and Thorn watch with huge, pleading eyes.

### 11.2 Saving Throws

Call for a **Charisma saving throw, DC 13**, from 1–2 selected characters (likely whoever has interacted most with the children).

- On **success**:
  > You feel a desperate, clinging presence trying to wedge itself into your thoughts—chilled fingers pressing against your mind. For a moment, you taste dust and tears. Then, with an effort of will, you shove it away. The cold recedes.

- On **failure**:
  > For a heartbeat, your vision swims. Your own thoughts are suddenly crowded by others—frightened, childlike, clinging. You hear a small voice inside your head whisper: "Don’t leave us… please…"  
  > Then everything snaps back into focus—but you don’t feel entirely alone in your own skin.

If you want to keep this simple:
- A possessed character might:
  - Become more cautious, reluctant to go downstairs.
  - Exhibit small mannerisms of Rose or Thorn.
- You can occasionally speak as the child inside their mind, but do not remove player agency.

**Prompt to the player (quietly, if possible):**
- "Inside, you feel a small, terrified consciousness. It doesn’t control you, but it begs you not to go downstairs and not to leave this room forever. How does your character react to carrying this child’s spirit?"

This gives a rich roleplay angle without heavy rules.

---

## 12. Preparing to Descend – Final Attic Beat

Once they have:
- Spoken with Rose and Thorn,
- Discovered the secret stair to the basement,
- Possibly found the children’s remains,

you are ready to transition them toward the **basement module** (next file).

### 12.1 Narration: The Threshold

> The secret stair gapes before you—a narrow throat of dark wood leading down into breathless black. No light touches the bottom. The air that rises from below is damp and cold, carrying the smell of earth, mold, and something older and sour beneath it all.
>
> Behind you, the children’s room lies silent. Toys scattered on the rug. Tiny beds neatly made. The dollhouse sitting open like a tiny reliquary of the horrors to come.

**Prompt:**
- "This is, as far as you can tell, the only way into the basement the children spoke of. Do you descend now? Do you rest here? Do you say anything before you go?"

### 12.2 Player Decision Branches

1. **They descend immediately.**
   - Move directly to the basement file (to be written: e.g. `07-Death-House-Basement-Part-1.md`).

2. **They choose to rest in the attic.**
   - The house allows a **short rest** but make it uneasy.

   **Rest Narration:**
   > You do your best to make yourselves comfortable in the attic. The floor is hard and cold, the air thin and dry. Dust irritates your nose and throat. Every few minutes, some part of the house creaks and pops, as if something heavy is shifting slowly in the walls.
   >
   > Sleep, if it comes at all, is shallow and restless, filled with dreams of narrow hallways and doors that won’t open.

   - If you allow a **long rest**, consider a nightmare or minor disturbance (a distant scream, chanting from below, etc.) that reminds them they’re not safe.

3. **They try to leave the house without going to the basement.**
   - According to lore, the house becomes hostile (see earlier files for mist/door changes).
   - Use the house’s responses from prior sections; this file focuses on the attic.

---

## 13. Strahd Interaction Hooks (Optional)

While Strahd is **not canonically active** in Death House, you can add subtle touches that **do not break lore** by framing them as **visions, distant laughter, or the land’s dark will**.

These are **optional** levers you can pull if you want Strahd present.

### 13.1 Mirror Vision (Attic Storage)

If a player looks into the cracked attic mirror and lingers:

> For a moment, your reflection wavers. The room behind you flickers—not the dusty attic, but a vast, shadowy hall lit by cold blue flames.
>
> Behind you in the reflection stands a tall figure in a dark, high‑collared cloak. His eyes are the color of fresh blood on snow. He watches you with the calm curiosity of a predator that isn’t hungry… yet.
>
> You blink, and the attic returns. The figure is gone. Only your own pale face stares back at you.

**If asked "Was he really there?":**
- Answer in character, vaguely:
  > It felt real. But the room around you hasn’t changed. No new sounds, no scent of another presence. If he was there… he leaves no trace you can sense.

This keeps lore: Strahd’s influence can reach dreams and visions without him physically entering.

### 13.2 Whisper on the Stair (As They Approach the Basement)

As the first character puts a foot onto the secret stair:

> In the back of your mind—no louder than a breathed word—you hear a voice. Smooth, amused, tinged with a faint accent you don’t recognize.
>
> "Down into the dark you go, little moths. Let us see if your light survives the first night in my land."  
> Then it’s gone, leaving only your own thoughts and the cold air rising from below.

If players ask who that was, you don’t name Strahd yet—just let the mystery simmer.
