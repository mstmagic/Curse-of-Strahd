# 1. Death House – Attic and Nursery (Level 2–3)

> This file is designed to be read aloud or followed *verbatim* by a brand-new, nervous Dungeon Master.
> It continues immediately from the upper floors material (Part 2) and assumes the party has just found the way to the attic.

---

## 1. DM Orientation

1. This section covers:
   1. Finding and entering the attic level.
   2. Exploring the attic storage areas.
   3. Discovering the locked children’s room and meeting the ghosts of Rose and Thorn.
   4. Learning key lore about Death House and the Durst family.
   5. Receiving the quest hook to find the secret stairs to the basement.

2. Expected party level: **Level 2**, possibly on the way to **Level 3** by the time they finish Death House.

3. Pacing goals:
   - Build **claustrophobia and dread** slowly.
   - Offer **many chances for roleplay** with Rose and Thorn.
   - Keep combat in this section **minimal**; the horror should be mostly emotional and atmospheric.

4. Safety (out-of-game reminder for you, the DM):
   - This scene involves **dead children** and themes of neglect and sacrifice.
   - Before the session, check with players if this is okay. If anyone is uncomfortable, you can:
     - Make Rose and Thorn **older teens** instead of young children.
     - Soften how much they remember of their deaths.

Do **not** read this safety note aloud; it is for you.

---

## 2. Transition: Reaching the Attic

Use this narration when the players locate the door or stairs that lead up from the upper floor to the attic:

**DM Narration (read aloud, slow and quiet):**

> The narrow wooden stairs groan under your weight as you climb higher. The air grows colder with each step, and the faint light from below fades until it’s swallowed by shadow. A musty, dry smell creeps into your lungs—dust, old wood, and the faint, sour tang of forgotten things.
>
> As you reach the top of the stairs, your heads brush against crooked rafters. The space above is close and oppressive, the ceiling slanting down to meet the outer walls. Cobwebs hang like grey curtains in the corners, and you can hear the gentle tapping of rain on the roof overhead.
>
> A single, weak window lets in a smear of grey light from the ever-present mists outside, but most of the attic is swallowed in gloom.

**Prompt (open-ended):**

> What do you do?

**Silence Prompt (for you, the DM):**
- After asking “What do you do?”, stay quiet for **10–15 seconds**.
- Let players talk among themselves and decide how they proceed.

---

## 3. Attic Layout Overview (For the DM Only)

Do **not** read this section aloud.

The attic is a cramped warren of:

1. **Dusty Storage Rooms** – trunks, old furniture, sheets, moldy smells. A chance to build atmosphere.
2. **Servants’ Quarters** – tiny rooms, simple beds, some personal items. Can foreshadow house’s cruelty.
3. **Locked Children’s Room** – where Rose and Thorn’s ghosts are found. The emotional center of this part.

From the official *Curse of Strahd* Death House appendix, the attic map includes several marked rooms. You don’t need to reference room numbers directly for the players, but you should know where:

- The **secret door** from the attic eventually leads toward the basement.
- The **children’s room** is located: a locked room containing the skeletons of Rose and Thorn, and their ghosts.

You can adapt the exact layout to your map, but keep these elements:

- A short **hallway** from the attic stairs.
- A few **empty / storage rooms**.
- One **important locked door** to the children’s room.

---

## 4. First Steps into the Attic – Exploration and Atmosphere

When the characters begin to explore the attic, use this scene.

**DM Narration (read aloud when they step fully into the attic):**

> As you step forward, old floorboards creak and flex, sending up little puffs of dust that glitter in the dim light. The air is so still that even your own breathing sounds too loud.
>
> Shapes loom in the half-dark—covered furniture draped with dusty sheets, the broken ribs of wooden crates, and crooked hat stands like skeletal arms. Cobwebs connect everything, forming sticky veils you brush aside as you move.
>
> You hear, very faintly, something shift in the wood above—a gentle settling, or perhaps small feet… but when you stop to listen, there is only silence.

**Prompt (closed-ended, to direct shy players):**

> Do you move quietly and carefully, or do you stride forward without worrying about the noise?

If the players answer:

- **“Quietly,” “carefully,” or similar**:

  **DM Response:**

  > You slow your steps, the boards creaking only softly under your weight. Your own heartbeats feel louder than your footfalls, and you catch yourself holding your breath as you ease past stacks of forgotten boxes.

- **“I don’t care about the noise,” “I just walk,” etc.**:

  **DM Response:**

  > Your steps thud on the aging boards, and the sound echoes a little in the cramped space. Somewhere deeper in the attic, you hear something small skitter away—perhaps a rat, or perhaps something else disturbed by your arrival.

- **If they debate or hesitate:**

  **DM Response:**

  > The attic waits. The house itself almost seems to be holding its breath.
  >
  > What do you do?

**Silence Prompt:**
- After each “What do you do?”, pause again.

---

## 5. Attic Storage Rooms

Let the party explore a few unimportant rooms first, to build tension.

### 5.1 Entering a Storage Room

When they enter any generic storage room:

**DM Narration (read aloud):**

> You push open a narrow wooden door. Its iron hinges shriek softly as it swings inward. The room beyond is choked with cobwebs and dust. Old, shapeless lumps—furniture, trunks, boxes—are stacked haphazardly, all draped in dingy white sheets like shrouds.
>
> The air here smells of dry rot and mouse droppings. Somewhere under the dust is the faint ghost of perfume and old wood polish.

**Prompt (open-ended):**

> How do you search the room?

### 5.2 Common Search Outcomes

If the players **search carefully** and take their time (say 5–10 minutes in-game):

- Have them make a **group Wisdom (Perception)** or **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.
  - DC 10: They find **mundane items**.
  - DC 15+: They might find **a minor useful item**.

**Mundane items (no real value, just flavor):**
- Moth-eaten cloaks.
- Broken toys.
- Cracked picture frames.
- Tarnished copper candlesticks (worth 1–2 gp if sold; mark that down).

**Optional Minor Loot (for DC 15+):**
- A small wooden box containing **5 silver pieces** and **3 copper pieces**.
- A simple silver pendant (worth 10 gp) with an engraving of a windmill.

**DM Narration for a successful search (customize as needed):**

> You lift dusty sheets and peer into old trunks, your fingers leaving trails through the grime. Most of what you find has long since lost its value—moth-eaten cloth, warped wood, broken household items.
>
> But after a while, you pry open a half-rotten box and find a small stash the family seems to have forgotten: a few dull coins and a simple silver pendant shaped like a tiny windmill.

**Prompt (closed-ended):**

> Do you take the coins and pendant, or leave them where they are?

- If they **take the loot**:

  **DM Response:**

  > You pocket the small treasure. As you do, a faint chill creeps up your arms, as if the house itself were watching you… and judging.

- If they **leave the loot**:

  **DM Response:**

  > You decide to leave the forgotten treasure undisturbed. The room remains still and silent, the dust settling slowly back into place.

**Saving Throws:**
- None required in these generic storage rooms unless you want to add a minor hazard (collapsing box, falling object, etc.). If you do add one, use:
  - **Dexterity saving throw DC 10** to avoid taking **1d4 bludgeoning damage** from a falling trunk or shelf.

---

## 6. Servants’ Quarters (Optional, Roleplay and Lore)

Use these rooms to show the cruelty and neglect of the Durst family.

**DM Narration (read aloud when they enter a small servants’ room):**

> This cramped room holds a pair of narrow beds pushed against opposite walls. The straw mattresses are thin and sagging. A single small chest sits at the foot of one bed; the other has only a neatly folded grey blanket, stiff with dust.
>
> On a tiny table between the beds lies an old clay mug and a chipped plate, both rimmed with dried, brown stains. A faint whiff of mold and stale sweat still lingers here, trapped in the fabric and wood.

**Prompt (open-ended):**

> Do you search the room, or just glance in and move on?

### 6.1 Searching the Servants’ Room

If they **search**:

- Ask for a **Wisdom (Perception)** or **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.
  - DC 10: They find **personal mementos**.
  - DC 15: They find **a small note or diary fragment**.

**Personal Mementos (flavor only):**
- A carved wooden toy soldier.
- A string of wooden prayer beads.
- A thin metal holy symbol of a **sun**, tarnished black (symbol of the Morninglord).

**Diary Fragment (lore, no mechanics):**

> “They say the master’s guests come for the rites below. We’re told not to look, not to listen. But the screams carry through the walls. The children hear them. I hear them. I pray the Morninglord turns his face back to this house… but each morning, the mist is thicker.”

**DM Roleplay Note:**
- Read the diary fragment aloud **slowly**, like reading a spooky story.

**Prompt (open-ended):**

> Hearing that, what do you do or say to each other?

**Silence Prompt:**
- After asking, stay quiet and let the players react.

---

## 7. Approaching the Locked Children’s Room

Eventually, the players will reach the **important locked door** leading to Rose and Thorn’s room.

**DM Narration (read aloud when they first see the door):**

> At the end of the narrow attic hallway, you find a closed wooden door. Unlike the other doors up here, this one is… cleaner. Less dusty. Its brass knob is dull but not green with age, and there are faint, small scratches around the keyhole—like someone with tiny hands tried to open it in a hurry.
>
> A simple iron keyhole sits just below the knob. The door is shut tight.

**Prompt (closed-ended to keep things moving):**

> Do you knock, try the handle, look for a key, or try to force the door?

### 7.1 If They Try the Handle

- The door is **locked**.

**DM Response:**

> You grasp the cold brass knob and twist. It rattles in your hand but doesn’t turn far enough to open. The door is locked.

**Prompt:**

> How do you try to get past the locked door?

### 7.2 If They Knock

Have them knock once or twice. Wait a beat, then use this.

**DM Narration (read aloud):**

> Your knock echoes dully in the cramped hallway. For a moment, there is nothing.
>
> Then, faintly, from the other side of the door, you hear the quiet sound of a child sobbing.

**Silence Prompt:**
- Let this land. Say nothing for a full 5–10 seconds.

Then:

**DM Narration (whisper-level voice):**

> The sobbing stops, and a small, trembling voice speaks from the other side of the door.
>
> “H-hello? Is… is someone there?”

This is **Rose**.

### 7.3 NPC: Rose and Thorn – How to Voice and Play Them

**Rose (Rosavalda Durst)**
- Age: around 10.
- Voice: soft, careful, slightly bossy older sister tone.
- Emotion: frightened, protective of her little brother, determined to sound “grown-up.”
- Personality: serious, easily annoyed by Thorn’s fearfulness.

**Thorn (Thornboldt Durst)**
- Age: around 7.
- Voice: higher, timid, sniffly from crying.
- Emotion: terrified of “the monster” and of being alone.
- Personality: clingy, anxious, looks to Rose for guidance.

**Acting Notes for You (DM):**
- When speaking as **Rose**, sit up straighter, speak more clearly, but keep your volume low and shaky.
- When speaking as **Thorn**, make your voice slightly higher and stutter or sniffle occasionally.
- Let them sometimes talk over each other; Rose will try to hush Thorn.

---

## 8. First Conversation Through the Door

### 8.1 Rose Speaks First

As soon as someone responds to the child’s “Is someone there?” use this dialog.

**DM (as Rose, quietly, through the door):**

> “We… we’re in here. We can’t get out. The door is locked. Are you… are you from the town? Did Mama send you?”

**Prompt to Players (open-ended):**

> How do you answer the little girl behind the door?

Give them a chance to speak. Then use these likely response branches.

### 8.2 Likely Player Responses and DM Replies

**Response A: “Yes, we’re here to help.”**

**DM (as Rose):**

> “You… you are? Oh. Oh, thank the Morninglord. My name is Rosavalda, but you can call me Rose. My brother is Thorn. We’ve been locked in here… we don’t know how long.”
>
> “There’s a monster in the house. Mama and Papa keep it in the basement. They lock the door so it can’t get out. But they never came back. We’re so hungry. Can you open the door, please?”

**Response B: “Who are you?”**

**DM (as Rose):**

> “My name is Rosavalda Durst. This is our house. Or… it was. My little brother Thorn is here with me. He’s scared.”
>
> “There’s a monster in the basement. Mama and Papa said they had to deal with it. They locked us in to keep us safe, but… they never came back.”

**DM (as Thorn, softer, maybe sobbing):**

> “I-I don’t like the monster. I don’t like being in here. Please… please don’t leave us alone.”

**Response C: “What monster?” / “Tell us about the monster.”**

**DM (as Rose):**

> “We don’t… we don’t know what it looks like. We just hear it. Sometimes it growls, low and horrible, from somewhere under the house. And… people scream. Mama says it’s all part of the rituals. She says we must stay upstairs and be good.”
>
> “Please. Can you open the door? We’re scared.”

**Response D: Players are suspicious and ask many questions**

You can loop parts of the above, but keep Rose’s main requests:

- She wants the door opened.
- She wants them to **stop the monster in the basement**.

**DM (as Rose, slightly frustrated but still frightened):**

> “I swear I’m telling the truth. We’re just children. We can’t do anything about the monster. Please… at least open the door so we’re not alone anymore.”

**Prompt (closed-ended):**

> Do you try to open the door, or do you keep talking through it?

---

## 9. Getting Into the Children’s Room

### 9.1 Methods of Entry

The players might:

1. **Pick the lock**.
2. **Break the door down**.
3. **Search for a key**.

Decide how difficult you want this to be. The house itself wants them to find the children, so don’t make it impossible.

**Picking the Lock:**
- **Dexterity check with thieves’ tools, DC 12.**

**DM Narration (if successful):**

> You kneel by the lock and work your tools into the mechanism. There’s a soft click, and the doorknob turns freely in your hand.

**Breaking the Door:**
- **Strength (Athletics) check, DC 12.** On a success, the door breaks inward.

**DM Narration (if successful):**

> You slam your weight into the door. The wood cracks with a loud snap, and the latch tears free of the frame. The door flies inward, banging against the wall and stirring a cloud of dust.

**Failing the Check:**
- If they fail once, let them try again, but describe noise and strain.

**DM Narration (on a failed attempt):**

> You throw your shoulder against the door, but it only shudders in its frame. Your impact sends dust drifting from the ceiling, but the lock holds—for now.

**Saving Throws:**
- None required for opening the door, unless you want to add a **splinter hazard**:
  - **Constitution saving throw DC 10** to avoid taking **1 piercing damage** from a nasty splinter after a failed forced entry attempt. This is purely optional.

### 9.2 Entering the Room

Once the door opens, read this.

**DM Narration (read aloud as they cross the threshold):**

> The room beyond is small and still. Faded, childish drawings are tacked to the walls—smiling stick figures, a crooked house, a round sun that looks too big for the sky.
>
> Two tiny beds sit against one wall, their blankets neatly made but grey with dust. A small dollhouse, almost as tall as a halfling, stands nearby, its doors hanging open to reveal miniature rooms inside that look disturbingly like the house you’ve been exploring.
>
> In one corner lie two small shapes, curled on the floor. As your eyes adjust, you see them clearly: the tiny skeletons of two children, their bones wrapped in tattered clothes.
>
> The air in here is colder than the hallway. It brushes your skin like the memory of a breath.

**Silence Prompt:**
- Pause 5–10 seconds and let them react.

---

## 10. Meeting the Ghosts Face to Face

As they take this in, the **ghosts of Rose and Thorn** manifest.

**DM Narration (read aloud):**

> As you stare at the tiny remains, the room seems to darken at the edges, as if the light is being slowly swallowed. A faint, pale glow rises from the two little skeletons, shapes of mist and memory pulling themselves together.
>
> In a heartbeat, you see them: a thin, solemn girl in a simple dress, clutching a doll, and a smaller boy in a rumpled shirt, his face streaked with phantom tears.
>
> Their eyes are large and hollow, but they look at you with a desperate hope.

**DM (as Thorn, almost whispering):**

> “Y-you came back. You really came…”

**DM (as Rose, trying to sound calm):**

> “We… we knew someone would come. Eventually.”

**Prompt (open-ended):**

> What do you do or say?

### 10.1 Likely Player Reactions and Your Responses

**If players are gentle or kind:**

**DM (as Rose, softer):**

> “You’re not like the others. They came for the basement. For the rites. They didn’t talk to us. They didn’t even look.”
>
> “Will you… will you help us? We don’t want to be alone anymore.”

**If players are horrified / suspicious / hostile (“What are you?” “Stay back!” etc.):**

**DM (as Thorn, flinching):**

> “D-don’t hurt us! Please! We’re just… we’re just children. We didn’t do anything.”

**DM (as Rose, defensive):**

> “We’re dead. We know that. The house wouldn’t let us out. It locked us here… until we stopped breathing. But we’re still here. We can’t leave. Not yet.”

**If players examine the skeletons:**

- Let them make a **Wisdom (Medicine)** or **Intelligence (Investigation)** check, DC 10.

**On success:**

> The skeletons look like they died of **starvation and dehydration**, locked here for days with no food or water.

**DM Narration (matter-of-fact but grim):**

> Their bones are in a natural, curled position, as if they lay down to sleep and never woke up. There are no signs of violence—only the quiet, cruel patience of time.

---

## 11. Extracting Lore and the Main Quest from Rose and Thorn

Your goal in this scene is to:

1. Explain the **monster in the basement**.
2. Point the party toward the **secret stairs**.
3. Offer emotional stakes: putting the children’s spirits to rest.

Use this dialog and adjust to player questions.

### 11.1 Explaining the Situation

**DM (as Rose):**

> “Mama and Papa had friends over. Strange people. They wore dark robes and whispered downstairs. They said they were making offerings to something in the basement. Something they called ‘the lord below.’”
>
> “When the screaming started, Mama locked us in here. She said it was to keep us safe. She… she never came back.”

**DM (as Thorn, voice shaking):**

> “We waited. We called for them. We cried until our throats hurt. But nobody came. We were so thirsty. So hungry. Then everything went dark.”

**Prompt (open-ended to players):**

> Hearing that, what do you ask them? Or what do you do next?

### 11.2 Direct Questions and Answers

**Q: “Where is the basement?” / “How do we get there?”**

**DM (as Rose):**

> “There’s a secret way. The grown-ups didn’t want anyone to see. It’s hidden in the house. We only found out because we watched them when they thought we were asleep.”
>
> “We know where you can find the door, but… we can’t leave this room. Not far, anyway.”

(If your version follows the book, the secret door is related to the **dollhouse**.)

**Q: “What monster is in the basement?”**

**DM (as Rose):**

> “We never saw it. Just heard it. Growling, hungry, in the dark. And the people… they chanted. They cried out to it. Then they screamed.”

**Q: “What do you want us to do?”**

**DM (as Rose):**

> “We want you to **stop the monster**. Make the house quiet again. Maybe then… maybe then we can rest.”

**DM (as Thorn):**

> “A-and… don’t leave us alone. Please.”

---

## 12. The Dollhouse and the Secret Stairs

When the players investigate the dollhouse, use this.

**DM Narration (when they first notice the dollhouse):**

> The dollhouse beside the beds is an ornate replica of the very house you’re standing in. Its exterior is crafted with eerie care: tiny windows with miniature curtains, a front door with a minuscule knob, even little carved bricks along the chimney.
>
> The front of the dollhouse stands open, revealing rooms and hallways inside—perfectly mimicking what you’ve seen so far.

**Prompt (closed-ended):**

> Do you examine the dollhouse closely?

If they **do**:

**DM Narration:**

> As you lean in, you see each tiny room in exact detail—beds, rugs, little painted books on tiny shelves. Your eyes trace the path you’ve walked: the front door, the parlor, the staircase, the upper floors… and then, something you haven’t seen yet.
>
> In the basement level of the dollhouse, you see narrow, hidden staircases and secret rooms not shown anywhere else in the house.

Have them make an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check, DC 10.

- On success, they clearly see the location of the **secret door** on the real house’s floor above.

**DM Narration (on success):**

> As you study the miniature, your finger pauses over a tiny section of wall. In the dollhouse, that wall swings outward like a hidden door, revealing a narrow staircase leading down.
>
> You recognize the wall—it’s on one of the floors you’ve already visited. In the real house, there must be a secret door there.

**Prompt (open-ended):**

> Who is holding the dollhouse, and what do you do with it now?

**Rules Note (for DM):**
- The dollhouse is fragile but not trapped.
- If they break it, you can still allow them to glimpse the secret layout.

### 12.1 Player Reactions

**If a player says they move or pick up the dollhouse:**

**DM Response:**

> The dollhouse is surprisingly heavy. Dust billows as you lift it, and for a moment, the tiny rooms inside seem to flicker as if lit by an unseen candle.

**Optional Spooky Flavor (no mechanics):**

> For just a heartbeat, you think you see tiny figures standing in the miniature rooms—shapes like people in dark robes—but when you blink, they’re gone.

---

## 13. Emotional Hook: Promises to the Children

This is where you give the players a strong emotional reason to go to the basement.

**DM (as Thorn):**

> “A-are you going to leave us here again? Like Mama and Papa did?”

**Prompt (direct to players):**

> How do you answer Thorn’s question?

Let them respond in character.

**If they promise to help:**

**DM (as Rose, nodding, trying to be brave):**

> “Then we’ll help you as much as we can. We can’t go far from this room, but… if you stay the night, we’ll watch over you. And we can tell you what we remember of the house.”

**If they refuse or are cold:**

**DM (as Rose, hurt):**

> “Then you’re no better than the others.”
>
> “Go, then. But the house won’t let you leave unless you deal with what’s below. You’ll see.”

**Acting Note:**
- Don’t punish the players mechanically if they’re harsh, but let the **mood** turn colder and less cooperative.

---

## 14. Possession Option (Rules-Accurate but Optional for New DM)

In the official adventure, Rose and Thorn can **possess** characters. You may want to simplify this, but here are the basics.

### 14.1 How Possession Works (simplified)

- A child’s spirit tries to enter a character.
- That character makes a **Charisma saving throw, DC 13**.
- On a failure, the child’s spirit **possesses** the character but does not control them completely—rather, it **overlays** its personality.

**Effects of Possession (suggested, gentle version):**
- Thorn-possessed: becomes more fearful, avoids dark places, hates being alone.
- Rose-possessed: becomes more cautious, slightly bossy about “proper” behavior.
- The character still remains in control of their actions, but their **roleplay is influenced**.

### 14.2 When They Might Try to Possess

This might happen if:

- The players refuse to stay with the children.
- The party tries to leave the room abruptly.
- A character shows **unusual kindness or sympathy**, and the child clings to them.

**DM Narration (when a child attempts possession):**

> As you turn to leave, you feel a sudden rush of cold air press against your chest. For a heartbeat, your breath catches, and the room seems far away.
>
> A whisper, like a child’s voice, curls around your thoughts: “Don’t… don’t leave me behind…”

**Ask the player for a Charisma saving throw (DC 13).**

- On **success**:

  **DM Response:**

  > You push the cold presence away with an effort of will. The whisper fades, and the room comes back into sharp focus.

- On **failure**:

  **DM Response:**

  > The cold sinks into you, threading into your thoughts. You feel a tightness in your chest, like you’re holding back tears that aren’t entirely your own.
  >
  > You gain the strange sense that you are no longer alone in your own mind.

**Quietly explain to the player (not aloud to everyone, unless your table is okay with it):**
- “You feel the spirit of Rose/Thorn inside you. You still control your character, but:
  - If it’s **Rose**: You feel a need to act properly, avoid chaos, and protect ‘your’ younger brother (anyone you decide that is).
  - If it’s **Thorn**: You feel scared of being alone or in total darkness. You might cling to another party member.”

**Optional Simpler Rule for New DMs:**
- Skip the Charisma save and possession entirely if it feels like too much.
- Instead, Rose and Thorn just ask, **“Please don’t forget us,”** and fade when the basement is cleansed later.

---

## 15. Planning the Descent – Ending the Scene

Once the players have:
- Talked to Rose and Thorn.
- Examined the dollhouse.
- Learned about the secret stairs.

…you should gently move them toward **finding the secret door** and heading downward.

**DM Narration (as Rose, firm but afraid):**

> “The house won’t let you leave. Not yet. It keeps the doors shut and the mists close until the monster below is… gone. We think if you stop it, everything will be different.”

**Prompt (closed-ended):**

> Do you leave the children’s room now to search for the secret door, or do you stay and talk longer?

### 15.1 If They Leave to Search

**DM Narration:**

> You step back into the attic hallway. The air feels somehow heavier now, as if the house is aware of what you’ve learned.
>
> Behind you, in the children’s room, the pale shapes of Rose and Thorn linger by their tiny beds, watching you with wide, hollow eyes.

**Prompt (open-ended):**

> Who leads the way as you go to find the secret door indicated by the dollhouse?

From here, transition to your material covering the **secret stairs to the basement**.

### 15.2 If They Stay Longer

Let them ask any last questions. Here are a few fallback lines.

**If players run out of questions:**

**DM (as Rose):**

> “We’ve told you everything we know. The rest… the rest is under the house.”

**DM (as Thorn):**

> “Please come back. Don’t leave us alone forever.”

**Prompt (closing):**

> When you’re ready to leave the room and head toward the secret stairs, tell me who is in front.


---

## 16. Optional: Strahd’s Distant Attention

To add subtle Strahd presence without breaking the low-level feel, you can include a brief supernatural hint.

**Trigger (optional):**
- Use this once the players promise to deal with the basement or after they handle the dollhouse.

**DM Narration (do NOT say this is Strahd by name):**

> For a heartbeat, the air in the room tightens, as if something far away has suddenly turned its gaze upon this house.
>
> A faint, cold wind—impossible this deep inside—stirs the children’s hair and the dust on the floor. The candle flames, if any, gutter and stretch sideways, then settle again.
>
> Somewhere, far in the distance, you think you hear the echo of a slow, amused chuckle carried on the mist.

**Prompt (soft, open-ended):**

> Do any of you react to that strange feeling?

This foreshadows Strahd’s awareness and interest without showing him directly.

---

## 17. Rewards and Progression

- **Information Gained:**
  - There is a “monster” in the **basement** related to occult rituals.
  - The **secret door** to the basement can be found using the **dollhouse** map.
  - The house itself **traps** people until the evil below is dealt with.

- **Loot:**
  - Small coins and a silver pendant from storage rooms (approx. 10–15 gp total value).
  - Optional personal mementos (no gold value but sentimental; may matter later if you want).

- **Experience / Milestone:**
  - This section is mostly roleplay and exploration. You can award XP for:
    - Discovering Rose and Thorn and learning the truth of their deaths.
    - Finding the dollhouse and locating the secret stairs.
  - Alternatively, if you’re using **milestone leveling**, you can mark this as progress toward reaching level 3 once Death House is fully complete.

---

## 18. Campaign Triggers and Notes

- **Trigger – Children’s Spirits at Peace:**
  - When the party eventually **defeats the shambling mound / resolves the Death House’s basement**, Rose and Thorn’s spirits can:
    - Appear one last time.
    - Thank the party.
    - Fade peacefully.

- **Trigger – If a Character Is Possessed:**
  - The influence of Rose/Thorn should **end** when the Death House’s evil is cleansed.
  - You can describe it as a warm feeling and a final whispered “thank you” in the possessed character’s mind.

- **Trigger – If Players Try to Leave the House Before the Basement:**
  - Doors are locked.
  - Mists outside are too thick, forcing them back.
  - You can have Rose/Thorn say, “The house doesn’t want to let you go yet.”

This concludes the **Attic and Nursery** section. The next file should cover **finding and descending the secret stairs into the Death House basement** and the horrors that wait below.
