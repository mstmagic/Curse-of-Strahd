# 1. Into the Mists – Scene-by-Scene Script (Levels 1–3)

> This file is a fully scripted, step-by-step guide for a brand-new, inexperienced Dungeon Master with weak acting skills. Read the boxed text out loud. Use the bullet points and acting notes as your private guidance.
>
> Timeline covered: From the moment the characters first enter the Mists until they reach the outskirts of the Village of Barovia and see Death House as the obvious first adventure hook.

## 1.0 DM Overview

1. This script assumes the characters have just finished a previous adventure in another world (any setting) and are now traveling on a road, through a forest, or across lonely countryside.
2. The Mists close in, trapping them in Barovia, as per *Curse of Strahd, Chapter 1: Into the Mists*.
3. You will guide them through:
   - 1.1 First Sign of the Mists
   - 1.2 Mist-Swallowed Road & First Horror Atmosphere
   - 1.3 Optional: Strahd’s Distant Attention
   - 1.4 The Gates of Barovia
   - 1.5 The Howling and the Corpse
   - 1.6 Optional: Wolves in the Fog (Encounter)
   - 1.7 First Distant View of the Village
   - 1.8 Death House Beckons

Use this document together with the official stat blocks and lore in the *Curse of Strahd* book and its appendices. When in doubt about rules, use the official book as the final authority.

---

## 1.1 First Sign of the Mists

**Goal:** Move the party from their old world into Barovia using eerie narration and simple choices.

### 1.1.1 Scene: The Road Grows Quiet

**DM Read-Aloud (slow, calm, slightly hushed):**

> The road beneath your feet feels strangely soft, as if the packed earth has forgotten it should be solid. The air cools, and a damp chill brushes against your faces like cold, clammy fingers. Sounds that should be here — birds, insects, the wind in the leaves — ebb away one by one, as if someone is turning down the volume of the world.
>
> Ahead, a low, colorless fog drapes itself across the path. It clings to the ground at first… then begins to rise.
>
> The smell of wet, rotting leaves and distant smoke seeps into your lungs, heavy and sour. The air tastes of iron and old rain.
>
> The fog ahead stirs, inviting and menacing all at once.

**Acting Notes (how to perform):**
- Voice: Use a quiet, even tone. Slow down more than feels natural.
- Pauses: After each paragraph, pause for 2–3 seconds to let players react.
- Body language: Lean slightly forward, hands relaxed, as if sharing a ghost story by a campfire.

### 1.1.2 Prompting Player Interaction

After you read the description, let the players talk. If they hesitate:

**DM Prompt (neutral tone):**

> The fog ahead thickens and curls, waiting for you. What do you do?

**Likely Player Responses and DM Guidance:**

- **Player:** “I move forward into the fog.”  
  **DM:**
  
  > You step forward. The fog is cool and damp, beading on your eyelashes and clinging to your clothes. Each footstep sounds dull, muffled, like you’re walking on wet wool.

- **Player:** “I look around for another path / try to go around the fog.”  
  **DM:**
  
  > You turn aside, pushing through undergrowth, searching for a path that avoids the fog. But the more you try to circle it, the more the fog seems to slide and stretch, quietly spreading between the trees. It does not rush you. It simply waits, like it knows you have nowhere else to go.
  
  (If they keep trying to avoid it, gently reinforce):
  
  > No matter how you angle your steps, the mist always seems to gather where you are headed. The world around you is growing dimmer and quieter with each minute.

- **Player:** “I test the fog with a stick / rock / mage hand.”  
  **DM:**
  
  > The object disappears into the fog, swallowed by gray. You hear no echo of its fall, no clatter, no splash. Just the damp silence pressing in.

- **Player:** “This feels dangerous — can I make a check?”  
  Ask for a **Wisdom (Survival) check** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** if they suspect magic.
  - **DC 12 Survival:** They recognize that fog or no, they are getting turned around, and staying in one place might be just as dangerous as moving forward.
  - **DC 12 Arcana:** The fog has an unnatural quality, likely magical, and seems to be herding them.

  **On a success, DM (softly):**
  
  > Whatever this fog is, it isn’t normal weather. It’s more like a wall than a cloud. Waiting here won’t save you from it.

### 1.1.3 Campaign Trigger – Entering Barovia

Once the players commit to moving into the fog (or after a few minutes of failed attempts to avoid it), you railroad gently:

**DM Read-Aloud:**

> You step into the fog.
>
> Instantly, the air grows colder. The mist thickens around you, swallowing your shapes, your footsteps, and soon the very memory of where you came from. The world becomes nothing but gray and the smell of wet stone and dead leaves.
>
> Your lungs ache with the cold damp. Each breath feels like dragging in a mouthful of smoke.

**Rules Note:** They are now effectively in the Domains of Dread. Normal methods of planar or long-distance travel will not work unless the adventure later permits it.


---

## 1.2 Mist-Swallowed Road & First Horror Atmosphere

**Goal:** Establish the oppressive horror tone and the sense that the domain itself is a prison.

### 1.2.1 Scene: Walking in Nowhere

**DM Read-Aloud:**

> Time stretches. You walk — minutes? Hours? The fog gives you no sun, no stars, no shadows. Only gray.
>
> Your footsteps are muffled and strange, like they’re happening far away. Now and then, a shape looms ahead in the mist — a twisted tree, a jagged rock, a tangle of dead brambles — then slides past you and vanishes again.
>
> Every sound you make seems too loud. The clink of armor. The creak of leather. The rasp of your own breathing.
>
> Somewhere out in the gray, something else is breathing too.

**Acting Notes:**
- Delivery: Speak just above a whisper. Let the final sentence hang, then go completely silent for 5–10 seconds.
- Silence Prompt: Do not rush to speak. Let the players fill the silence with their own fear and questions.

**DM Prompt (after the silence, if needed):**

> The mist rolls and curls around you. The road beneath your feet feels more like packed mud than stone now. What do you do?

### 1.2.2 Skill Checks & Mild Disorientation

If players try to navigate or track time:
- **Wisdom (Survival) DC 15:** No matter how they try to mark their way, the landscape does not behave correctly. Landmarks vanish.
- **Intelligence (Nature) DC 12:** This is not natural fog. Weather does not behave this way.

**On any success, DM:**

> You are certain of one thing: this fog wants you to keep walking… but not out. In.

If players argue about going back:

> You turn around and walk the way you think you came. The fog obeys… for a while. Then the ground subtly slopes down, the air grows even colder, and you feel — more than see — the road curve back to where it wants you to go.

---

## 1.3 Optional: Strahd’s Distant Attention

**Purpose:** Give the DM an early taste of Strahd without a direct confrontation. This section is **optional**, but highly recommended.

### 1.3.1 How to Play Strahd’s Presence

Strahd is not visible here, but the Darklord is aware of new souls entering his domain.

**Acting Notes for Strahd (voice & attitude):**
- Accent: Smooth, Eastern European–inspired, but do not force it. Focus more on calm, controlled arrogance.
- Tone: Amused, curious, utterly confident, as if watching new pieces added to a game board.
- Pace: Slow, deliberate, like a predator unhurried by prey.

### 1.3.2 Scene: A Hunter in the Fog (Optional Vision)

**Trigger:** Use this if you want to foreshadow Strahd early, or if players are restless.

**DM Read-Aloud (only the first two paragraphs are heard by the characters):**

> For a heartbeat, the mist parts ahead of you.
>
> Through the veil of gray, far, far off, you see a dark shape on a distant rise — a tall figure on horseback, cloak fluttering like the wings of a bat. Red eyes, or perhaps it’s just a trick of the fog, glimmer in the distance.

Pause. Let players react.

**If a player says they blink / look again:**

> You blink, and the fog folds back in with a soft, wet sigh. The figure is gone. Only the cold remains, pressing tighter around your hearts.

**Private DM Note (not read aloud):** That was Strahd von Zarovich, observing the newcomers.

### 1.3.3 Likely Player Responses

- **Player:** “I shout at the figure!”  
  **DM:**
  
  > Your voice vanishes into the fog, swallowed almost as soon as it leaves your lips. No answer comes.

- **Player:** “I run toward them!”  
  **DM:**
  
  > You surge forward, boots pounding the soft ground. But with each step the fog thickens, then the figure blurs, then it is simply gone, as if it had never been there at all.

- **Player:** “Can I make a check to know who that was?”  
  Here, knowledge is limited. If they are from Ravenloft or have relevant background, you can allow **Intelligence (History) DC 18** to sense the presence of something legendary and wrong. Otherwise:
  
  > Whoever it was, they rode like they owned the world — and everything dying in it.

---

## 1.4 The Gates of Barovia

Now follow the official *Chapter 1: Into the Mists* description of the Iron Gates, but with more sensory detail and step-by-step prompts.

### 1.4.1 Scene: The Walls of the Dead Forest

**DM Read-Aloud:**

> The fog begins to thin, clinging low to the ground like a dirty blanket. Shapes appear ahead of you — first as blurry shadows, then as towering walls of ancient trees. Their trunks are black with damp, their branches knotting together high overhead like gnarled fingers trying to strangle the sky.
>
> The smell of rot is stronger here. Mushrooms sprout from fallen logs, sickly white and yellow. Crows watch you from above, feathers puffed against the cold, their eyes glinting like dark beads.

**DM Prompt:**

> The road continues ahead, disappearing between these looming trees. What do you do?

Let players take small actions (listen, look around, draw weapons). Reward caution with description rather than bonuses.

### 1.4.2 Scene: The Iron Gates

**DM Read-Aloud (based on the book, expanded):**

> As you press on, the trees draw back from the road, revealing a set of enormous iron gates hanging from stone pillars.
>
> Each pillar is carved with the weathered relief of a mournful, faceless figure — perhaps a warrior once, or a guardian — now eroded by time and sorrow. The iron bars of the gate are cold and slick with moisture, streaked with orange rust like dried blood.
>
> The gates stand slightly ajar. Pale mist snakes between their bars and spills out onto the road like breath from a corpse.

**Acting Notes:**
- Voice: Add a hint of awe, as if the players are approaching something very old and very important.
- Body: Sit or stand a little straighter when you describe the gates; these are the threshold to Barovia.

**Silence Prompt:**  
After the last sentence, stay quiet for 5 seconds. Let players ask questions first.

### 1.4.3 Player Interaction & Checks

**Common Actions & Suggested Responses:**

- **Inspect the pillars (no check needed unless looking for secrets):**  
  **DM:**
  
  > The stone is slick and cold under your fingers. Lichen has crept into every crack, and rain has carved thin, tear-like channels down the faces of the carved figures.

- **Search for traps – Intelligence (Investigation) DC 13:**
  - **Success:** No traps. Just old stone and iron. The danger here isn’t mechanical.
  - **Failure:** Same as success, but they feel uneasy anyway.

- **Listen beyond the gate – Wisdom (Perception) DC 12:**
  - **Success:**
    
    > Far beyond the gate, carried faintly on the cold air, you hear a lonely wolf howl. Then another answers. And another.
  
  - **Failure:**
    
    > The wind whistles softly between the bars, but you hear nothing else.

**DM Prompt:**

> The gates stand waiting, open just enough to admit you. What do you do?

### 1.4.4 The Gates Close

Once the last character passes through, trigger the classic gate slam from the book.

**DM Read-Aloud (sudden, louder):**

> As the last of you steps beyond the gates, the iron bars shudder.
>
> With a thunderous clang that echoes through the trees, the gates swing shut on their own, their bars slamming together like the teeth of a trap. The sound rolls through the forest and dies away into a heavy silence.

**Acting Notes:**
- Raise your voice suddenly on “thunderous clang” to startle the table.
- Then immediately drop back to a low tone.

**Likely Player Responses:**

- **Player:** “I try to reopen the gate.”  
  **DM:**
  
  > You strain against the iron bars. They don’t even rattle. It’s like trying to move part of the mountain itself.

- **Player:** “This place is a prison.”  
  **DM (quietly, leaning in):**
  
  > The forest ahead waits. Behind you, the gates are closed. There is only one way to go.

---

## 1.5 The Howling and the Corpse

Follow the *Into the Mists* encounter with the corpse and the letter, adding scripting.

### 1.5.1 Scene: The Distant Howls

**DM Read-Aloud:**

> You walk on beneath the clawing branches of the forest. The road is slick with wet, black mud and scattered with dead leaves that cling to your boots.
>
> Somewhere to your left, a wolf howls — long, low, and hungry. Another answers from the right. Then another, ahead.
>
> The sound seems to circle you.

**Silence Prompt:**  
Say nothing for a few seconds. Let the players react.

**DM Prompt (if needed):**

> The howls fade, but the sense of being watched does not. What do you do?

### 1.5.2 Scene: The Corpse in the Road

After a few more minutes of travel (or when things lull), introduce the corpse.

**DM Read-Aloud (based closely on the book text, expanded):**

> The fog curls back from something lying in the middle of the road.
>
> At first, it looks like a bundle of old rags. Then you see a pale hand, fingers stiff and curled, reaching toward the gray sky.
>
> A human corpse lies sprawled across the dirt, face-down. The clothing is tattered and soaked with long-dried blood, the colors leached away by damp and time. Crows hop nearby, watching you with bright, greedy eyes.

**Acting Notes:**
- Lower your voice when saying “human corpse.” Let those words carry weight.

**DM Prompt:**

> The body lies still. The crows ruffle their feathers and wait. What do you do?

### 1.5.3 Investigating the Corpse

**If the players approach:**

- **Wisdom (Perception) DC 10 (passive is fine):**
  
  > The corpse is of a middle-aged man. His skin is pale with a faint gray tinge, lips drawn back from his teeth. A deep claw mark rips across his back.

- **Search the body – Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10:**  
  On a basic success (or just if they search carefully), they find the familiar letter from “Strahd.” Use the text from the book (the forged letter written by the Burgomaster of Barovia, if you follow the standard hook) but read it aloud with villainous elegance.

**How to Read the Letter (Strahd’s false letter):**
- Voice: Smooth, aristocratic, with a hint of cold amusement.
- Pace: Slow and controlled. Enjoy every word.

**DM Read-Aloud (example framing, replace with exact book text from your copy):**

> Tucked inside the man’s coat, you find a sealed letter, its parchment damp but intact. The red wax bears the impression of a stylized dragon, wings spread wide.
>
> The ink has run in places, but the handwriting is beautiful and precise.

(Read the letter from the book here.)

**After reading, DM Prompt:**

> The letter falls silent in your hands. The corpse does not move.
>
> The wolves, somewhere out in the fog, howl again.
>
> What do you do?

### 1.5.4 Saving Throws & Fear (Optional)

If your group likes horror, you can ask for a mild **Wisdom saving throw DC 10** when they fully realize they are trapped, hunted, and receiving ominous letters.

- **On success:** They steel themselves; no mechanical effect.
- **On failure:**
  - Short-term roleplay effect for the scene: racing heart, shaky hands, terse speech.
  - No mechanical penalty unless you and the players enjoy that style.

Remind them this is about atmosphere, not punishing them.

## 1.6 Optional Encounter: Wolves in the Fog

Use this to add early danger or if the party is too relaxed. Adjust difficulty for a level 1–3 group.

### 1.6.1 Encounter Setup

- **Location:** Forest road between the Gates and the Village of Barovia.
- **Party Level:** Designed for level 1–3.
- **Suggested Monsters:**
  - 3–6 Wolves (MM), depending on party size and level.
- **Battlefield Layout (Theater of the Mind or Simple Grid):**
  - Narrow, muddy road (15–20 feet wide).
  - Dense trees and heavy underbrush on both sides (counts as difficult terrain, lightly obscured).
  - Fog provides **lightly obscured** conditions beyond 30 feet: ranged attacks at disadvantage beyond that range, and Perception checks that rely on sight are at disadvantage.

### 1.6.2 How to Run the Ambush

**DM Read-Aloud (just before combat):**

> The howls draw closer.
>
> The fog thickens around your ankles, then reaches your knees. Shapes move between the trees — low to the ground, fast.
>
> A growl rolls out of the mist to your left. Another to your right. Yellow eyes flash, here and gone, as something circles you.

**DM Prompt:**

> The shapes close in. You can feel hot, hungry breath somewhere just beyond the fog. What do you do?

Give them a chance to ready actions, draw weapons, or huddle together.

**Then:**

> Without warning, wolves burst from the fog!

**Roll initiative.**

### 1.6.3 Wolves – Quick Reference

Use the standard **Wolf** stat block from the Monster Manual / Appendix D.

- **Pack Tactics:** They have advantage on attack rolls if an ally is within 5 feet of the target.
- **Trip Attack:** On a hit, DC 11 Strength saving throw or the target is knocked prone.

**DM Notes:** Target front-liners first, but occasionally have a wolf flank and go for weaker-looking characters to reinforce danger.

### 1.6.4 Saving Throws & Checks in Combat

- Wolves knocking characters prone: **Strength save DC 11.** Describe them being dragged into the mud.
- If a character drops to 0 HP, describe it in a horror style:
  
  > You feel teeth sink into your flesh, a shock of pain and cold. The world tilts as the wolf yanks you down into the mud. The sky, what little you can see of it through the branches, goes gray as the fog closes in.

### 1.6.5 Ending the Encounter

When 1–2 wolves are killed, the rest may flee if you like, howling into the fog.

**DM Read-Aloud (as they retreat):**

> The surviving wolves back away, teeth bared, fur bristling. Then, as if hearing a silent command, they turn and vanish into the fog. Their howls echo between the trees as they go.

**Loot:**
- No gold; these are wild beasts.
- If the party searches the area, allow them to find:
  - A half-buried, rusted **shortsword** (mechanically normal, worthless as trade but usable).
  - Shreds of old clothing from previous victims.

---

## 1.7 First Distant View of the Village of Barovia

### 1.7.1 Scene: The Land Reveals Itself

As in the book, the road eventually leaves the forest and leads toward the Village.

**DM Read-Aloud:**

> At last, the oppressive press of the trees begins to thin. The road slopes gently downward, and the fog loosens its grip, rising from the ground to hang in tattered veils.
>
> Ahead, through the gray curtains, you glimpse the shapes of buildings — crooked roofs and chimneys, leaning walls, thin plumes of smoke rising weakly into the colorless sky.
>
> The smell hits you next: damp wood, cold ashes, and something sour underneath, like spoiled wine or old sweat.
>
> A village slumbers in the mist below.

**Acting Notes:**
- Tone: Tired, heavy. This is not a cheerful town.

**DM Prompt:**

> You stand at the edge of this strange land, looking down at the mist-shrouded village. What do you do?

### 1.7.2 Optional Strahd Interaction – Overlooking His Domain

This is another **optional** point for Strahd to appear, far away, perhaps on a balcony of Castle Ravenloft or as a shadow on a distant hill.

**DM Private Note:** Look for a moment when the players are quiet, taking in the view.

**DM Read-Aloud (if you choose to use this):**

> Far beyond the village, higher up the valley, a dark shape looms through the fog — a colossal fortress perched on a rocky promontory. Lightning flickers behind its high towers, tracing its outline against the clouds.
>
> For just a second, you think you see a lone figure on one of the balconies, cloak stirring in the wind. Then the fog curls up around the fortress and swallows it whole.

**Acting Notes for Strahd (if someone focuses on the figure):**
- If a player uses a spyglass, magic, or keen senses to catch more detail, describe the same tall, black-clad figure as before, with the faintest red gleam to his eyes.

**Likely Player Questions:**

- **“What is that place?”**  
  **DM:**
  
  > From here, you can’t see details. But even at this distance, the fortress dominates the valley like a king on a throne.

- **“Do I feel anything when I look at it?”**  
  **DM:**
  
  > Your stomach clenches with a mix of fear and grim fascination, like staring over the edge of a high cliff.

---

## 1.8 Death House Beckons (Hook Setup Only)

You will use the full Death House script in its own dedicated files. This section positions the players at the edge of the Village of Barovia and points them naturally toward Death House.

### 1.8.1 Entering the Village

**DM Read-Aloud (inspired by Chapter 3, Village of Barovia, but focused on tone):**

> You descend the road into the village.
>
> Tall shapes loom out of the fog around you — the sagging profiles of old houses, their windows staring like dark, empty sockets. Wooden shingles curl and peel from their roofs. Rot-blackened doors hang crooked on twisted hinges.
>
> The air here is still and heavy. No children laugh. No dogs bark. Somewhere, a window shutter bangs softly in the wind, again and again, like a heartbeat.

**Acting Notes:**
- Speak slowly. Emphasize the emptiness.

**DM Prompt:**

> The street stretches ahead of you, swallowed in mist. Now and then you see a faint candle-glow behind warped glass… then it disappears as someone shutters the light.
>
> What do you do?

Let them explore a little. Provide vague, unsettling NPC glimpses (shapes at windows that retreat, a door that opens a crack then closes). Keep them moving toward the Death House corner.

### 1.8.2 Death House Introduction (Without Entering Yet)

**Location:** A particular house standing at the edge of the village street: the Death House.

**DM Read-Aloud (when they come near):**

> As you follow the muddy street deeper into the village, the fog thickens again, curling around your knees.
>
> On one street corner, a tall brick row house looms over the road like a watchful guardian. Unlike its sagging neighbors, this house is still in good repair — its windows unbroken, its red tile roof intact.
>
> A wrought-iron gate, partly ajar, guards a small front yard choked with yellowed weeds. Dark, curtained windows look down on you, blank and unblinking.

**NPCs:** Rose and Thorn (the ghostly children) will be fully scripted in the dedicated Death House file. Here, you only need to hint at them or introduce them briefly if the players approach.

**Acting Notes (preparing for the children):**
- Rose: Slightly formal, trying to be brave, maybe a little bossy. High, precise voice.
- Thorn: Younger, timid, soft-spoken, occasionally sniffling.

### 1.8.3 Campaign Trigger – Starting Death House

**Trigger:** The party investigates the house, the yard, or hears crying children.

**DM Teaser Read-Aloud (when you are ready to move into the full Death House adventure file):**

> As you approach the iron gate, you hear it: the thin, frightened sob of a child.
>
> It comes from the fog-dimmed street just beyond the house — a little girl’s voice, trying very hard not to sound afraid, and failing.

**DM Prompt:**

> The house looms over you, and a child’s sobbing trembles in the mist.
>
> What do you do?

At this point, switch to the dedicated Death House step-by-step file (e.g., `03-Death-House-Exterior-and-Children.md`), which will include full narration, NPC dialogue, acting notes, combat details, and Strahd interaction hooks for that location.

---

## 1.9 Future Files and Structure (For the DM)
