# 1. Into the Mists & Death House – A Fully Scripted Opening (Levels 1–3)

> This file is meant to be read verbatim by a brand-new, inexperienced Dungeon Master. When in doubt, literally read the boxed dialog and narration out loud. Notes labeled **DM NOTE**, **ACTING NOTE**, or **RUNNING THE GAME** are for you to read silently.

---

## 1.1 Session Zero and Hook into the Mists

### 1.1.1 DM Overview

**DM NOTE:** This section assumes the characters are already traveling together in a relatively safe world (any standard D&D setting). Your immediate goal is to:

1. Establish that the characters know each other and have a reason to stay together.
2. Create a sense of normalcy before the supernatural horror of Barovia.
3. Lure them into the Mists that will trap them in Strahd’s domain.

You can use any existing hook from your home game. If you don’t have one, use the following.

### 1.1.2 Opening Narration – A Normal Road

**Read aloud:**

> The road beneath your boots is familiar in the way all old roads are. Packed earth, rutted by carts and horses, darkened here and there where last night’s rain still clings in shallow puddles. The air smells of wet soil and crushed grass. Somewhere in the distance, a lark sings a simple, cheerful song.
>
> The sky is a pale gray-blue, streaked with thin clouds. A cool breeze brushes your faces and tugs at cloaks and hair. Behind you lies the last village you passed through: a small, forgettable place with warm fires and warmer ale. Ahead, the road curves between low hills and patches of sparse woodland.
>
> For a brief moment, everything feels…safe. Ordinary. As if this is just another day of travel in a world that, while dangerous, still makes sense.

**Prompt (open-ended):**

Say to the players:

> Take a moment and describe how your character looks as they travel along this road. How do they walk? What are they doing to pass the time?

**Silence Prompt:**

After asking, **stay silent for at least 10–20 seconds**. Look from player to player. Let them fill the silence with description and small talk in-character.

If they hesitate, gently prod:

> If you’re not sure, just give a simple picture. Are you riding, walking, fidgeting with something, humming to yourself?

### 1.1.3 The First Hint of Mists

**DM NOTE:** Now we begin the slow, unsettling transition into the Mists, as described in *Curse of Strahd* Chapter 1, but with more sensory detail. This is still safe—no combat yet.

**Read aloud:**

> As you continue along the road, you notice a thin whiteness along the low-lying fields and in the dips between hills. At first, you think it’s just morning fog, clinging to the coldest places. But as you walk, the haze grows thicker.
>
> The lark’s song fades. The breeze stills. The only sounds now are your own footsteps and the soft creak of leather and metal as you move.
>
> The air grows damp and cool. Each breath feels a little heavier, like you’re inhaling not just air, but tiny droplets of water that cling to your throat.
>
> Ahead, the road vanishes into a slowly shifting wall of gray mist.

**Prompt (closed-ended):**

Ask the players:

> Do you keep moving forward into the mist, or do you stop here to investigate or turn back?

#### Likely Player Responses & Your Replies

1. **“We keep going.”**  
   **DM Response (read aloud):**
   
   > You tighten your grips on weapons and packs and step forward, the mist curling around your boots like fingers. With every step, the world beyond your immediate reach fades.

2. **“We stop and check the mist.”**  
   Ask:
   
   > What exactly do you do to check it? Do you poke it, throw something in, listen, or something else?

   Then respond based on their action:

   - **They poke the mist or throw something in.**  
     **DM Response:**
     
     > Whatever you toss vanishes quickly into the gray. You hear no impact, no echo. It is swallowed completely, like a pebble dropped into deep water. When you poke a weapon or hand toward the mist, cool dampness clings to the exposed surface, leaving it beaded with condensation.

   - **They cast a spell like Detect Magic or similar.**  
     **DM NOTE:** The Mists are intensely magical and part of Barovia’s prison. It’s fine to say they sense overpowering magic but not understand it.

     **DM Response:**
     
     > As you focus your senses, the mist ahead hums with a thick, oppressive magic. It is not a spell you recognize, nor does it feel like anything natural. It’s like standing at the edge of an invisible storm: heavy, alien, and utterly beyond your control.

3. **“We turn back.”**  
   **DM NOTE:** Per the book, the Mists surround them. If they turn back, they find more Mists and eventually are forced onward.

   **Read aloud:**
   
   > You decide not to risk the mist and turn around, heading back the way you came. For a few minutes, the road feels familiar again. You recognize a crooked fencepost, a large boulder you passed earlier.
   >
   > But then, without any clear moment of change, you realize the air is just as damp and heavy behind you as it was ahead. Thin tendrils of mist creep along the ground from both directions.
   >
   > You walk faster. The mist thickens. You break into a jog. The road under your feet remains the same, but the world around you is swallowed in gray.
   >
   > No matter how far or how fast you go, the mist draws closer, until it presses in from every side.

   **Prompt (closed-ended):**

   > The mist is closing in from all directions. Do you stand your ground together, or do you try something desperate—like running off the road, climbing, or splitting up?

   **DM NOTE:** Whatever they do, the Mists win—but let their choices matter in how it feels.

   - **If they stand together:**  
     **Read aloud:**
     
     > Shoulder to shoulder, you stand your ground as the mist rolls over you—cold, wet, and blinding. Your lungs burn as you breathe it in. Eyes sting. Your hearts pound in your chests.

   - **If they try desperate actions (running, splitting up, etc.):**  
     **Read aloud:**
     
     > You dash, scramble, and strain against the world closing around you. Trees, road, landmarks—everything vanishes behind curtains of gray. Your breaths come ragged and sharp; your chests ache as the air grows thick and cold.
     >
     > No matter how you struggle, the mist flows around your ankles, then your knees, then your waists, until you are swallowed whole.

### 1.1.4 Transition to Barovia

**DM NOTE:** This matches the spirit of *Into the Mists* but with fuller sensory detail. This is not a combat encounter; it’s a mood-setting transition.

**Read aloud:**

> For a timeless moment, there is nothing but gray. You can’t see your own hands. You can’t see one another. All sound is muffled, as if you’ve been wrapped in damp wool.
>
> Your lungs burn. Your eyes water. Your thoughts slow, as if moving through cold syrup. The world narrows to the feeling of wet cloth clinging to your skin and the copper taste of fear at the back of your throat.
>
> Then, as suddenly as a held breath being released, the pressure lifts.
>
> The mist thins, drawing back like a curtain. Shapes emerge: dark, skeletal trees with bare branches; a narrow dirt road under your feet; and, in the distance ahead, a looming set of iron gates, flanked by headless stone statues half-swallowed by fog.
>
> The cheerful sky you left behind is gone. Above you hangs a low, unbroken ceiling of thick gray clouds. The air smells of wet leaves, cold stone, and something faintly rotten, like old, stagnant water.

**Prompt (open-ended):**

> You feel disoriented and not entirely sure how much time has passed. What does your character do or say in this moment?

**Silence Prompt:**

Remain quiet and let them react. If no one speaks after 15–20 seconds, gently prod with something like:

> Even a muttered curse, a nervous joke, or a quiet prayer tells us something about your character.

---

## 1.2 The Svalich Woods and the Gates of Barovia

### 1.2.1 General Mood and Environment

**DM NOTE (lore-accurate):** You are now in Barovia, as described in Chapter 1 of *Curse of Strahd*. The land is under Strahd’s control. Daylight is dim and gloomy. The Svalich Woods are oppressive. Wolves and ravens are common background elements. This is still roughly **level 1–2** territory.

**Read aloud:**

> The trees crowd close on either side of the road, their trunks dark and damp, their branches bare and claw-like. The ground is littered with soggy leaves and patches of black mud. A chill clings to everything, crawling under armor and through cloth.
>
> In the distance, you hear the lonely caw of a crow—or perhaps a raven—echoing through the woods. No other birds sing. No insects buzz. The silence feels wrong.
>
> Ahead, the road leads straight toward the looming iron gates. They rise more than twice your height, their bars thick and cold, beaded with droplets of moisture that glisten dully in the dim light.
>
> On either side, headless stone statues of armored guardians slump in their niches, their severed heads lying cracked and moss-covered at their feet.

### 1.2.2 Optional Early Strahd Presence (Raven on the Gate)

**CAMPAIGN TRIGGER – OPTIONAL STRAHD INTERACTION #1:**  
Use this if you want Strahd’s awareness to be felt very early.

**Read aloud (optional):**

> As you draw nearer to the gates, a dark shape flutters down from the branches above and lands atop one of the stone guardians. A large black raven, feathers glossy even in this dim light, tilts its head and fixes you with one beady, intelligent eye.

**ACTING NOTE – Voice for the Raven (if a player uses magic to speak with animals):**

- Tone: Quick, nervous, warning.  
- Style: Short sentences, as if the bird is always ready to fly away.  
- Underlying emotion: Fearful of “him” (Strahd), but hopeful that the characters might be different.

**If someone casts *Speak with Animals* or similar, say:**

> The raven’s head jerks toward you, and you sense its thoughts sharpening into words you can understand.

Then, as the raven:

> “Fools… strangers… You walk into his talons. Turn back, turn back. This valley is a cage. Strahd watches. Strahd hungers.”

**Likely Player Responses & DM Answers:**

1. **“Who is Strahd?”**  
   Raven (nervous, clipped):
   
   > “The lord… the master… the devil of this land. The sky, the wolves, the dead—they all answer to him. He is the storm that never ends.”

2. **“How do we leave?”**  
   Raven:
   
   > “No way. No way I know. Those who come, stay. Those who try to flee… vanish in the mist. Or worse.”

3. **“Why warn us?”**  
   Raven:
   
   > “Because maybe… maybe you are the ones. The ones the old stories whisper about. Or maybe you die screaming like the rest. Either way, you will stir the nest. And I hate the way it stirs.”

After this brief exchange, have the raven fly off:

> With a sudden flick of its wings, the raven launches itself into the air and vanishes into the trees, leaving you alone before the gate.

### 1.2.3 The Gates Open

**DM NOTE:** This is a classic Barovia moment. Keep it slow and eerie.

**Read aloud:**

> As you approach within a stone’s throw of the gates, a low groan of metal rumbles through the air. The iron bars shudder, then slowly begin to swing inward on unseen hinges.
>
> The sound is long and drawn-out, like a dying animal’s last breath. Cold air spills out from beyond, carrying the faint scent of damp stone and distant smoke.
>
> No one stands nearby. No hands touch the gate. It opens for you, as if the land itself has been waiting.

**Prompt (closed-ended):**

> The gates stand open, inviting or threatening—or both. Do you walk through now, or do you spend time examining the statues, the ground, or the surroundings first?

**Likely Player Responses & DM Replies:**

- **Examine the statues or area (Perception/Investigation checks):**  
  Ask for a roll if they want details (DC 12–15).  
  
  **On a success:**
  
  > The stone is cold and slick with moisture. Deep claw marks run across the chests and arms of the statues, as though something large and powerful raked stone with unnatural strength. The marks are old, edges softened by time.
  >
  > You also notice that the iron bars of the gate bear no rust where they swing, despite the damp air. Someone—or something—maintains them.

  **On a failure:**
  
  > The statues are worn and weathered, their details softened and half-lost to moss and time. Whatever stories they once told have eroded away.

- **Step through the gate:**  
  **Read aloud:**
  
  > You step past the threshold of the iron gates. As the last of you passes through, the groaning rumble returns. The gate swings slowly shut behind you with a final, echoing clang.
  >
  > The sound rolls through the trees and fades into the distance, like a closing tomb.

- **Try to keep the gate open (wedging or holding it):**  
  Let them try. The gate is heavy but not impossible. However, *when they move far down the road*, the Mists or Strahd’s will cause it to close anyway.

  **If they wedge it:**
  
  > You jam a piton or heavy object into the gap. For now, the gate stays as you leave it.

  **Later, if they look back:**
  
  > You glance back over your shoulder. The gate you wedged open now stands firmly shut, your piton nowhere in sight. Only the empty, staring niches of the headless guardians remain.

## 1.3 The Death in the Woods (Optional Corpse Encounter)

**DM NOTE (lore-accurate):** The original adventure provides a dead body with a letter from “Kolyan Indirovich” warning about Strahd. This scene is key for tone. We will script it fully.

This encounter is **non-combat** and suitable for **level 1–2**.

### 1.3.1 Finding the Corpse

**Read aloud:**

> The road winds through the dark woods, the trees pressing close. A faint wind stirs the branches, making them creak like old bones.
>
> After several minutes of walking, the smell hits you first: the sour-sweet stench of decay, faint but unmistakable.
>
> A few steps later, you see it. Lying in the underbrush beside the road is the body of a man, half-covered in dead leaves. His clothes, once fine, are now torn and muddied. Ravens hop nearby, pecking cautiously at the corpse, their black eyes watching you as you approach.

**ACTING NOTE – Ravens:**  
- No speech (unless magic is used), but act wary.  
- Have them hop away a few feet, then return if players leave the body alone.  
- They are part of the Vistani/Keepers of the Feather theme, but you don’t need to reveal that yet.

**Prompt (open-ended):**

> The smell is strong up close, and the sight is grisly. What do you do?

### 1.3.2 Searching the Body

**DM NOTE:** According to the book, the corpse carries a letter. Keep gore tasteful but unsettling.

If the players search the body:

**Read aloud:**

> You push aside damp leaves and torn cloth. The man’s skin is pale and waxy, his eyes cloudy and unseeing. Deep claw marks rake across his chest and throat, as if torn open by something with long, brutal talons.
>
> In one stiff, cold hand, clutched against his chest, you find a sealed envelope, stained with mud and dried blood.

**ACTING NOTE – Handling Horror:**

- Speak a little slower.  
- Let your tone drop, quieter than normal.  
- Avoid smiling or joking; stay serious and respectful.

#### The Letter

**DM NOTE:** Use the official false letter (from Strahd impersonating Kolyan) as in the book. Do not change its meaning; only read it clearly. If you do not have the exact text at hand, paraphrase the following version that matches the source’s intent, or copy it from the handout in the markdown file.

**Read aloud, as if you are the letter’s writer (formal, weary, but with a sinister undertone):**

> “Hail to thee of might and valor,
>
> I, the Burgomaster of Barovia, send you honor—with despair. My adopted daughter, the fair Ireena Kolyana, has been these past nights bitten by a creature calling its race ‘vampyr.’ For over four hundred years this creature has drained the lifeblood of my people. Now, my dear Ireena languishes and dies from an unholy wound caused by this vile beast.
>
> He has become too powerful to conquer. So I say to you, give us up for dead and encircle this land with the symbols of good. Let holy men call upon their power that the devil may be contained within the walls of weeping Barovia.
>
> Leave our sorrows to our graves, and save the world from this greater evil.
>
> There is much wealth entrapped in this community. Return for your reward after we are all departed for a better life.
>
> Kolyan Indirovich, Burgomaster of Barovia.”

**DM NOTE:** This letter is actually from Strahd, forged to mislead. Don’t reveal this yet.

**Prompt (open-ended):**

> Having read this letter, what thoughts or plans does your character voice aloud, if any?

**Silence Prompt:**

Let them discuss. Do not rush. If they stall:

> You stand in the chill of the woods, the dead man at your feet, the letter in your hands. The road ahead leads deeper into this unknown land. What do you do?

### 1.3.3 Loot and Details

**Loot:**

- A small pouch with **8 gp** and **12 sp** in worn, unfamiliar coins stamped with the image of a stern-faced man (Strahd).  
- A simple silver ring on one finger, worth **15 gp** if sold.  
- Torn, muddy clothes that were once fine quality (no resale value now).

**Prices (if later sold in Barovia):**

- Locals in the **Village of Barovia** or **Vallaki** will buy the ring or coins at **50–75%** of standard PHB values due to scarcity and fear. You can say something like:  
  
  > “The merchant eyes the ring nervously, then you. ‘Times are hard,’ he says. ‘I can offer you 7 gold for it, no more.’”

**Campaign Trigger:**  

- Once the players have found this letter, they have an **explicit reason** to seek the **Village of Barovia** and its burgomaster. This gently points them toward the main story.

---

## 1.4 Approaching the Village of Barovia and Death House Hook

**DM NOTE (lore-accurate):** After the woods, the road leads to the **Village of Barovia**. The optional **Death House** stands at the edge of the village. It is a level 1–3 intro dungeon. We will present Death House as an eerie side-quest that still strongly tugs the characters inward.

### 1.4.1 First Sight of the Village

**Read aloud:**

> As you follow the road, the trees begin to thin. The smell of wet earth is joined by another scent: woodsmoke, faint and acrid.
>
> The road descends a gentle slope, and at last the woods open into a fog-shrouded village. Gray, sagging houses press close to the narrow streets, their windows dark and empty. The buildings lean like tired men, their roofs bowed under the weight of years and neglect.
>
> A low blanket of fog curls around the foundations of the houses, clinging to the ground like something that refuses to let go.
>
> No cheerful lights burn in the windows. No laughter spills from taverns. The only sound is the occasional creak of a loose shutter and the distant, mournful howl of a wolf.

**Prompt (open-ended):**

> As you stand at the edge of this strange, bleak village, what does your character do or say?

**Silence Prompt:** Give them time to react. This is a key moment.

### 1.4.2 Optional Early Strahd Interaction #2 – The Watching Presence

**CAMPAIGN TRIGGER – OPTIONAL STRAHD INTERACTION #2:**  
Use this if you want Strahd’s unseen presence felt the moment they enter the village area.

**Read aloud (subtle, internal sensation):**

> For just a heartbeat, you each feel something—a sensation like the weight of unseen eyes pressing against the backs of your skulls. The hairs on your arms and neck rise.
>
> There is no one in sight. No figure in a window, no shape in a doorway. Yet it feels, unmistakably, as though someone is observing you with calm, cold interest.
>
> Then, as quickly as it came, the sensation fades, leaving behind only the fog and the silence.

**DM NOTE:** This is Strahd noticing the newcomers. No combat. No direct interaction. Just the feeling.

---

## 1.5 The Death House Children (Main Hook)

**DM NOTE (lore-accurate):** Death House is an optional haunted house at the village’s edge. The classic hook is two children—**Rose** and **Thorn**—asking for help with a “monster in the basement.” We will now script this in detail.

### 1.5.1 Setting the Scene

**Read aloud:**

> As you take your first steps into the village, your boots thudding dully on damp, packed earth, the fog curls around your ankles like clinging fingers.
>
> Most of the houses you pass are dark and silent, their doors shut tight. The air smells of wet wood, old smoke, and something sour—like spilled wine left to rot.
>
> Then, cutting through the silence, you hear it: the thin, wavering sound of a child crying.

**Prompt (closed-ended):**

> The crying seems to come from somewhere up ahead and to the right, partly muffled by the fog. Do you go toward the sound, ignore it, or do something else first?

**Likely Player Responses & DM Replies:**

1. **They go toward the sound:**  
   **Read aloud:**
   
   > You follow the sound of weeping through the fog-shrouded streets. After a short walk, you see them: two small figures standing near the gate of a tall, narrow townhouse.
   >
   > The house rises three stories high, its stone foundation damp and dark. The upper floors are made of aged, gray brick. Its windows are dark, with iron bars across the lower ones. A rusting gate of wrought iron stands slightly ajar.
   >
   > In front of the gate stand a girl and a younger boy. The girl wears a simple but once-fine dress now slightly dirty at the hem. Her auburn hair is pulled back with a faded ribbon. The boy clutches a small stuffed toy—a headless doll—tight against his chest. Both look pale and frightened.

2. **They ignore the sound:**  
   **DM NOTE:** Death House is valuable for levels 1–3. Gently redirect them without forcing.

   After a few minutes of wandering elsewhere, repeat the crying from a new direction:

   > As you walk away, the village remains eerily silent… until once more you hear it: the thin, sad crying of a child, now from somewhere just around the next corner.

   If they repeatedly refuse, you may skip Death House, but it’s recommended for new characters. If they still insist, *mark Death House as “skipped” in your notes* and transition them toward other early Barovia hooks (Burgomaster’s mansion, church, etc.).

3. **They investigate cautiously (stealth, scanning, drawing weapons):**  
   Allow this. The children don’t flee unless attacked.

### 1.5.2 NPCs: Rose and Thorn

**Lore-accurate summary:**

- **Rosavalda “Rose” Durst** – Slightly older sister, poised, trying to be brave.  
- **Thornboldt “Thorn” Durst** – Younger brother, shy, scared, clutching doll.  
- Both are **spirits**/ghostly apparitions presenting as living children initially.

#### How to Act and Voice Rose

**ACTING NOTE – Rose:**

- Voice: Slightly formal for a child, careful diction, trying to sound grown-up.  
- Tone: Contained fear; she’s trying not to cry.  
- Mannerisms: Holds Thorn’s shoulder protectively, stands between him and strangers, glances nervously at the house.

**Rose – First Lines (read aloud as Rose):**

> “P-please… excuse me, sirs and madams,” she says, voice trembling but polite. “There is… there is a monster in our house. Our parents locked it in the basement, but…”
>
> She swallows hard, eyes glistening.
>
> “We’re afraid to go back inside.”

#### How to Act and Voice Thorn

**ACTING NOTE – Thorn:**

- Voice: Soft, higher, almost whispering.  
- Tone: Clearly terrified, easily spooked.  
- Mannerisms: Clings to Rose’s dress, squeezes his doll, hides behind her when spoken to.

**Thorn – First Lines (read aloud as Thorn):**

> “I don’t want to go back,” the boy mumbles, half into his sister’s dress. “The monster will get us. It… it growls, and the house shakes…”

### 1.5.3 Likely Player Questions and Scripted Answers

**DM NOTE:** Stay consistent with the Death House lore from Appendix B. The “monster” is actually the **shambling mound** and the cult’s remnants, but the children do not truly understand this.

1. **“Who are you?”**  
   - Rose:  
     
     > “My name is Rosavalda Durst, but you can call me Rose. This is my brother, Thornboldt. Our house is… is right here.”

2. **“Where are your parents?”**  
   - Rose (looking at the house):  
     
     > “They went to deal with the monster. They said they would keep it locked in the basement so it wouldn’t hurt us. But we heard… we heard screams.”
   - Thorn (quietly):  
     
     > “Mama screamed and screamed, and then it stopped…”

3. **“What does the monster look like?”**  
   - Rose (shaking her head):  
     
     > “We’ve never seen it. We only hear it—roaring and… and something heavy scraping on the floor. The whole house shakes sometimes.”

4. **“Why are you outside?”**  
   - Rose:  
     
     > “Our parents told us not to go to the basement. So when the monster started roaring again, we came out here and waited. But they haven’t come back for us.”

5. **“Are there others inside?”**  
   - Rose:  
     
     > “Our baby brother, Walter… he should be in the nursery upstairs. Please… please, you have to make sure he’s all right.”

### 1.5.4 The Ask – Enter the House

**Rose’s Plea (read as Rose):**

> “Please,” Rose says, her hands twisting together. “You look brave. Adventurers. Heroes. Won’t you go inside and stop the monster? We’re so afraid.”

**Thorn’s Add-on (read as Thorn):**

> “Don’t make us go back in,” Thorn whispers. “Just… just make the monster go away.”

**Prompt (closed-ended):**

> Do you agree to help the children and enter the house, refuse and walk away, or try something else—like questioning them further or investigating the outside first?

**Likely Player Responses & Outcomes:**

1. **Agree to help and enter the house:**  
   Move to **Section 1.6: Entering Death House – Ground Floor** (to be expanded in subsequent file or later sections).

2. **Refuse and walk away:**  
   - Rose tries one more time:  
     
     > Rose’s lower lip trembles. “Please… don’t leave us alone. The fog comes closer when no one is near. It feels like it’s… waiting.”

   - If they still leave, the Mists can subtly steer them back or you can let them skip Death House and move on to other Barovia content.  
   - **Optional Strahd Interaction #3 – Amused Spectator:** If they leave, you may later have Strahd comment mockingly on their choice (“You passed by a house crying for blood and did nothing…”).

3. **Investigate the exterior first:**  
   - Let them walk around the building. Describe high, barred windows, steep roof, and heavy door. No obvious signs of the “monster” outside.  
   - The children stay near the front, watching them anxiously.

---

## 1.6 Placeholder – Inside Death House

**DM NOTE:** The full interior of Death House (rooms, floors, encounters, shambling mound, cult history, loot, and Strahd interaction points) will be expanded in subsequent sections and/or files, following Appendix B of *Curse of Strahd* with heavy scripting.

For now, you have:

- Brought the characters into Barovia through the Mists.  
- Introduced the oppressive tone of the land.  
- Given them a lore-hook letter about Strahd and Ireena.  
- Brought them to the edge of the Village of Barovia.  
- Connected them to the optional—but highly recommended—Death House via Rose and Thorn.

**Next Writer Task (meta-note):** Expand Death House interior as **Sections 2.x+** in a new file, such as `02-Death-House-Interior.md`, maintaining chronological and level-appropriate structure, with full narration, acting notes, encounters, loot, and Strahd-trigger points.
