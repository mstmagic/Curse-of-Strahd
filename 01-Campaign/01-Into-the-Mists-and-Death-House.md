# 1. Into the Mists & Death House (Levels 1–3)

> This file is a step‑by‑step, read‑aloud script for a brand‑new Dungeon Master. Whenever you see text in **boxed italics**, that is narration you can read word‑for‑word. Dialogue in **bold quotes** is what an NPC actually says. Stage directions and advice to you, the DM, appear in regular text.

---

## 1.1 Session Overview

**Intended level:** Start at level 1; characters should reach level 2 during Death House and be close to level 3 upon escaping it.

**Scope of this file:**
- The characters’ first contact with the Mists of Barovia
- Being drawn into Barovia and arriving on the Old Svalich Road
- Reaching the Village of Barovia
- Being lured into **Death House** (Appendix B of the book) and escaping it
- Several optional Strahd appearances tailored to his interests
- Optional side hooks to re‑track wandering players

You do **not** need to know the whole campaign yet. This chapter is designed so you can run it just by following the script and consulting the monster stat blocks in the official book or SRD.

---

## 1.2 Where to Start from the Book

For lore accuracy, this chapter is based on:

- **Curse of Strahd Book-02-Chapter 1 Into the Mists**
- **Curse of Strahd Book-03-Chapter 2 The Lands of Barovia** (especially Old Svalich Road & Village of Barovia overview)
- **Curse of Strahd Book-19-Appendix B Death House**

Use those files as reference when you want to double‑check details. All narration and events here stay faithful to them but are heavily expanded and scripted.

## 1.4 Into the Mists: Hooking the Characters

You can start the characters in any world. The important thing is that they are **outside Barovia** when the Mists first appear.

Below are two ready‑to‑use openings. Choose one, read the narration aloud, and follow the flow.

### 1.4.1 Opening A – On the Road at Night

**Tone:** Creeping dread, isolation, the sense that the world is thinning around them.

**Sensory focus:**
- Sight – lantern light, encroaching darkness, pale gray mist
- Sound – creaking wagon wheels, distant wolf howls
- Smell – cold damp air, wet earth
- Touch – chill seeping into clothes, prickle of static on skin
- Taste – metallic taste of coming storm

**Narration (read aloud):**

***“Night settles over the road like a heavy cloak.

Your footsteps and the creak of wagon wheels are the only sounds for miles. The last village you passed is long behind you, its warm lights swallowed by the dark. Clouds smother the stars, and the moon is just a pale blur behind them.

A cold wind rises, carrying the smell of wet earth and distant rain. It cuts through your clothes and raises goosebumps along your arms. The trees on either side of the road crowd closer together, their branches knitting over you like skeletal fingers.

Up ahead, the night thickens into a low‑lying gray fog that clings to the ground and curls around the roots of trees.

The road vanishes into that mist.

Somewhere far away, a wolf howls. Another answers it… closer.”***

**Acting notes for you:**
- Speak **slowly, softly**, with deliberate pauses.
- Lower your voice when describing the fog, as if something might hear you.
- When wolves howl, raise the volume suddenly to make players jump.

**Prompt your players:**

Say: **“What do you do?”**

If they hesitate, allow a few seconds of silence. Look at each player in turn. Let the quiet build tension.

**Likely player responses & your replies:**

1. **“We keep going down the road.”**  
   Reply with narration:
   
   ***“You press on.

The mist thickens around your boots. Each step makes the world a little smaller. The trees become pale shapes. The road beneath you is little more than a suggestion, a darker strip beneath the swirling gray.

The air grows damp and cold. Your breath fogs in front of you.

You walk for what feels like several minutes… but when you glance back, the world behind you has vanished. There is only fog.”***

2. **“We leave the road / go around the fog.”**  
   **Narration:**
   
   ***“You push through the undergrowth, branches clawing at your clothes and armor. The fog curls around the trees, rolling between them like ghostly water.

No matter which way you turn, the fog simply waits ahead of you. Behind you. To both sides.

The forest is disappearing into a wall of gray.”***

   Then say, calmly but firmly: **“It seems there is no path that avoids the mist.”**  
   Then: **“What do you do?”**

3. **“We turn back.”**  
   **Narration:**
   
   ***“You turn around and begin to retrace your steps.

The fog thickens anyway.

In only a dozen heartbeats, the world is reduced to a circle of dim ground at your feet. Trees fade into pale shadows. The road is gone. The wind goes quiet. There is only your breathing, and the soft, whispering swirl of the mist.”***

   Then: **“You realize you have lost any sense of direction. The fog presses close, cool and clammy against your skin.”**  
   Prompt again: **“What do you do?”**

4. **“I test the fog / reach into it / use magic on it.”**  
   - If they reach in:  
     
     ***“The fog curls around your hand like cool, damp silk. It stings your eyes and nose with the faint, acrid smell of smoke… and something sweet and rotten, like flowers left too long in water.”***

   - If they cast a simple spell like *gust*, *thaumaturgy*, etc.:  
     
     ***“Your magic tugs at the mist, parting it for a heartbeat… and then it slides back into place, completely unbothered, as though it has all the time in the world.”***

   Calmly: **“The mist is not natural. It feels… deliberate.”**

---

### 1.4.2 Opening B – In a Tavern or Safe Place

Use this if you prefer to start with the party together, indoors.

**Narration (read aloud):**

***“Warmth and light fill the common room.

A fire crackles in the hearth, painting the wooden beams in shades of amber and gold. The smells of roasting meat, spilled ale, and damp wool mingle in the air. Voices rise and fall: laughter, the clink of mugs, the low mutter of gossip.

For a few precious hours, the dangers of the road feel far away.

Then the fire sputters.

The flames shrink, hissing, as if doused by unseen water. Conversations falter. The air grows cold enough that your breath turns to faint mist.

Outside, the wind howls.

Thick gray fog presses against the windows like a living thing.”***

**Acting notes:**
- Start with an easy, friendly tone. Then, when the fire falters, drop to a more serious, tense voice.
- When you say “like a living thing,” narrow your eyes, lean forward.

**Prompts:**
- **“What do you do?”**

**Likely responses & your replies:**

1. **“I look out the window.”**  
   
   ***“Outside, the world has vanished.

The tavern stands alone in a sea of pale gray. Trees, road, nearby buildings—all gone, swallowed by the fog. It presses against the glass in slow, rolling waves, as though breathing.”***

2. **“I go outside.”**  
   
   ***“The moment you open the door, the fog pours in—cold and wet, coiling around your ankles.

The warmth of the common room is devoured in seconds. Your skin prickles with chill.

Beyond the threshold, there is only fog. The village, the road, the world you knew—gone.”***

   Then: **“As you step outside, you feel the ground tilt beneath you, as if the world itself is shifting. Your stomach lurches. The door slams shut behind you of its own accord.”**

3. **“I stay inside / bar the doors.”**  
   
   ***“You bar the doors and windows. The fog still presses in.

Minutes creep by.

One by one, the patrons of the tavern grow quiet. Their faces blur at the edges, as if painted in watercolors and smeared by a careless hand.

You blink.

When your eyes open again, the chairs and tables around you stand empty. The fire is dead. The room is cold and still.

You are alone.

The door creaks open, and fog spills inside, enveloping you.”***

   Fade to white, then continue with Section 2.

---

## 2. First Contact with the Mists

No matter how they approach it, the Mists take the characters. The goal is to make it feel like a **mysterious force of nature and will**, not a simple trap.

**Narration (read aloud when they are surrounded):**

***“The fog closes in.

Sound dies first. The wind fades to a whisper and then to nothing at all. Your footsteps are swallowed, leaving only the soft rasp of your own breathing.

Then sight.

Shapes blur. Colors drain away. The world becomes gray and white and shadow.

The air is cold and damp, each breath tasting faintly of smoke and old incense. Your clothes cling to you with chill moisture.

For a moment, you feel weightless, as though the ground has fallen away.

Then your feet slam into solid earth.”***

Pause. Look at the players. Give them a few seconds of silence.

Then continue:

***“The fog thins.

You stand on a rutted dirt road, slick with moisture. On either side, dark, towering trees rise into a colorless sky. Their branches knit overhead, forming a canopy that lets in only a dim, gray light.

Behind you, the road disappears into a wall of pale mist that hangs between the trees like a curtain.

Ahead, the road winds deeper into the forest… and into more fog.”***

Say: **“You do not recognize this place. Your sense of direction is gone. The sun is a gray smear behind the clouds.

What do you do?”**

**Likely responses & your replies:**

1. **“I try to go back through the fog we came from.”**  
   
   ***“You walk toward the curtain of fog.

The closer you get, the colder the air becomes. Your breath turns to thick white clouds. Your skin aches with chill.

You step into the fog.

For a few steps, you see only white. Your lungs burn. Your chest tightens.

Make a Constitution saving throw.”***

   - **Saving throw:** DC 10 Constitution. On a success, say:  
     
     ***“You stumble back out of the fog, gasping, eyes watering. Behind you is the same forest road you left, unchanged. The fog will not let you pass.”***

   - On a failure, say:  
     
     ***“Pain lances through your chest. Your vision darkens at the edges.

You stagger backward, fall to your knees, and cough, tasting iron.

You manage to drag yourself out of the fog. For a moment, you are sure you were going to suffocate.”***  

   Then, to the group: **“You get the sense that the Mists themselves forbid you to leave.”**

2. **“I look around / search the area.”**  
   
   ***“The forest is unnaturally quiet.

No birds call. No insects buzz. The only sound is the occasional distant crack of a tree settling in the windless air.

The smell here is damp earth, wet leaves, and a faint, sour hint of decay.”***

   If they search more thoroughly (10+ minutes), allow a Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Nature) check, DC 10, to realize:

   - The trees and undergrowth are not from their home region.
   - The road is old, deeply rutted by many wagons over many years.

   Tell them plainly: **“Wherever you are, it is very far from where you started.”**

3. **“We follow the road.”**  
   This leads into the next section.

---

## 3. Old Svalich Road: Arrival in Barovia

This section corresponds to **Old Svalich Road** in Chapter 2 of the book.

Your goals here:
- Reinforce the **oppressive, haunted** feel of Barovia.
- Introduce the massive **gates of Barovia**.
- Optionally, show evidence of Strahd’s rule (corpses, wolves, ravens).

### 3.1 Marching down the Road

**Narration (read aloud when they follow the road):**

***“You set off along the muddy road.

The forest presses close on both sides, a wall of trunks and tangled undergrowth. The trees are tall and unnaturally still, their bark dark with moisture. Black crows watch from the branches with unblinking eyes.

Every few steps, the damp earth sucks at your boots with a soft, wet sound.

The air smells of wet leaves, old rot, and something else—an underlying bitterness you can’t quite place.”***

Pause, then ask: **“What formation are you walking in, and who is keeping an eye out?”**  
This invites players to engage with travel.

Let one character roll **Wisdom (Perception)** or **Wisdom (Survival)** (DC 12) to notice signs of predators—large wolf tracks in the mud.

**On success:**  
***“You spot deep, fresh tracks in the mud. Large wolves, at least half a dozen, have been using this road recently. The tracks go both directions.”***

**On failure:**  
Just keep the atmosphere tense. You can reveal wolves later during an encounter.

---

### 3.2 The Corpse on the Road (Optional Hook)

This is based on the letter‑bearing corpse from the book.

**Use this if you want an early hint of Strahd and Barovia’s village.**

**Narration (read aloud):**

***“After perhaps an hour of trudging through the cold, you spot a dark shape lying in the road ahead.

As you draw closer, the shape resolves into a body facedown in the mud, clothes stiff with dried blood. Crows perch on the nearby branches, watching in silence.”***

Say: **“What do you do?”**

**Likely actions & your replies:**

1. **“I investigate the body.”**  
   
   ***“The man is human, middle‑aged, his skin pale and bloodless. His throat has been torn out by something with very large teeth.

Pinned to his jacket by a muddy dagger is a folded letter sealed with red wax. The seal bears the image of a stylized dragon.”***

   Ask: **“Do you open the letter?”**  
   If yes, read the letter from the book (or paraphrase following its content). Use a **formal, sorrowful** tone.

   **Acting notes (letter’s tone):**
   - Voice of a desperate Burgomaster, weary but determined.
   - Speak slowly, with occasional catches in your voice.

2. **“I check for loot.”**  
   The corpse has:
   - 8 cp, 12 sp in a small pouch  
   - Muddy traveling clothes  
   - The dagger pinning the letter (simple dagger, no magic)

   **Prices note:** These coins are Barovian; treat them as normal D&D currency (copper/silver) for now.

3. **“I leave it alone.”**  
   The body remains, crows watching. The letter can be found later if they return, or you can skip it; the campaign still works.

---

### 3.3 The Gates of Barovia

Soon after the corpse (or after more walking if you skipped it), they reach the giant gates.

**Narration (read aloud):**

***“The road finally widens as the trees fall back from a pair of enormous stone gates.

On either side of the road, high stone walls disappear into the mist. Set into the walls are rusted iron gates that hang open. Flanking the gates are two headless stone statues of armed guardians, their weather‑worn bodies draped in moss.

The air here is colder. Your breath puffs in front of you in thick clouds.”***

Pause. Let them react.

**Voice and acting notes:**
- Describe these gates as ancient and **indifferent**—they are not welcoming anyone.
- Speak with respectful awe; this is their literal boundary into Strahd’s domain.

**Prompts:**

- **“What do you do?”**

**Likely responses & replies:**

1. **“We go through the gates.”**  
   
   ***“As you pass between the stone guardians, a slow creak echoes through the fog.

Behind you, the rusted gates swing shut on their own with a dull, echoing clang.

The sound rolls through the forest like distant thunder… and then fades into silence.”***

   Then, softly: **“You are inside Barovia now.”**

2. **“I examine the statues / walls.”**  
   
   ***“The stonework is old—centuries, at least. Deep cracks run through the statues’ armor. Moss and lichen cling to every surface.

Where their heads should be, the stone is jagged and broken, as though carved off by tremendous force.”***

   If a character makes a Religion or History check (DC 12), you may hint that these guardians once symbolized protection, now long lost.

3. **“We try to keep the gates open / wedge them.”**  
   Let them attempt, but make it clear the fog beyond the gates is impenetrable and suffocating, the same as before. The symbolism: **no escape**.

---

## 4. Approaching the Village of Barovia

After the gates, more travel brings them to the outer edges of the Village of Barovia.

**Narration (read when the village comes into view):**

***“The forest thins at last.

The road leads you into a valley shrouded in rolling fog. Ahead, the gray shapes of buildings emerge from the mist: a small, sullen village pressed against the cliffs.

Tall, bare trees loom over sagging houses with dark, empty windows like black, watchful eyes. The cobblestone streets are slick with moisture and strangely empty.

No children play. No merchants call. No one laughs.

The only sound is the occasional sob that carries faintly on the cold air.”***

**Sensory details:**
- Smell – woodsmoke, damp wood, faint sewage
- Sound – distant sobbing, creak of a sign in the wind, ravens cawing
- Sight – peeling paint, boarded windows, muddy streets, leaning houses

Say: **“As you step into the village proper, that distant sobbing becomes clearer—somewhere, someone is crying, over and over, without stopping.”**

Then: **“What do you do?”**

**Likely responses & your replies:**

1. **“We follow the sound of crying.”**  
   This can lead **either** to Mad Mary (book canon) **or** to the children in front of Death House. For this file, we’ll aim the first crying directly at **Death House** to keep the intro streamlined.

   Move to Section 6 next.

2. **“We explore / look for an inn / talk to locals.”**  
   Use this moment to paint **background NPCs** and Barovian mood while still herding them toward Death House.

   **Background villagers (no major plot yet):**
   - **Hunched Old Woman:**  
     - **Voice:** Gravelly, tired, Barovian accent (slight Eastern European lilt).  
     - **Body language:** Hunched, clutching a shawl, avoids eye contact.
   - **Dialog snippet (if hailed):**  
     
     **“Please… keep your voice down. The master hears everything.”**  
     (If asked who the master is:)  
     **“Strahd. Always Strahd. Now go. Go inside. The streets are not safe.”**

   Use them briefly, then let the distant crying pull the party’s attention.

   You can say: **“Even as you speak, that soft, relentless sobbing continues in the distance, tugging at your attention.”**  
   Then ask: **“Do you ignore it, or go see who is crying?”**

3. **“We ignore the crying and keep moving through town.”**  
   Let them wander a bit. Describe more empty streets, shuttered windows, and fearful faces peeking from curtains.

   After a few minutes of this, gently re‑track:

   - A pair of children (Rose and Thorn) appear at the end of the street, or
   - A villager nervously points them toward the “haunted house” where “the children stand alone and will not come inside.”

   Move to Section 6.

---

## 5. Optional: First Glimpse of Strahd

This is an **optional** early Strahd interaction. It should feel like a distant presence, not a direct confrontation.

**Trigger suggestions:**
- The party crosses the Gates of Barovia.
- Or they first step into the Village of Barovia.

**Concept:** Strahd briefly observes them from afar—perhaps as a silhouette on a distant rooftop or a bat that lingers too long.

**Narration (use once, if desired):**

***“For a brief moment, the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.

The air feels heavier, as though someone has just stepped into the room behind you.

You glance around.

On a distant rooftop, barely visible through the fog, you think you see a tall figure in a dark cloak, watching you with still, predatory patience.

Then the fog curls thickly between you. When it clears, the rooftop is empty.”***

**Acting notes (Strahd’s presence):**
- Lower your voice when you say “predatory patience.”
- Let there be a long pause after “When it clears…” before saying “the rooftop is empty.”

If a player calls out or tries to interact:

- The figure vanishes completely. Maybe a single **black bat** flies away, its wings making small leather‑soft flaps in the silence.

This hints at Strahd’s interest without changing anything mechanically yet.

---

## 6. The Crying Children and Death House Hook

This section leads directly into **Death House** from Appendix B.

Two pale children stand outside a tall, brick row house—the infamous Durst family home.

### 6.1 First Sight of the Children

**Narration (read aloud):**

***“As you turn down one narrow street, the crying becomes clearer.

The houses here lean over the road, their upper stories almost touching. Their windows are black and empty.

Ahead, one house stands a little prouder than the rest—three stories of gray stone, its iron gates hanging open. A pair of children stand just outside the gate.

The older girl, perhaps ten, wears a faded red dress and clutches a small doll. The younger boy, maybe five, hides half behind her skirt, his face blotchy from crying.

They are alone on the street.”***

**NPCs:**
- **Rose (Rosavalda Durst)** – serious, trying to be brave.  
  - **Voice:** Slight Barovian accent, high but composed.  
  - **Body language:** Protective stance in front of Thorn, frowning with concentration.
- **Thorn (Thornboldt Durst)** – frightened, clingy.  
  - **Voice:** Soft, wavering, sniffly.  
  - **Body language:** Clutching Rose’s dress, peeking from behind her.

**Prompt:**
- Say quietly to the players: **“The little boy’s eyes widen as he sees you. The girl straightens her back, as if trying to look more grown‑up.

What do you do?”**

Allow silence here. Let players choose to approach or not.

### 6.2 Children’s Opening Dialogue

If the party approaches within speaking distance, Rose addresses them.

**Rose’s dialog (read in character):**

***Rose (bravely):*** **“P‑please… can you help us?”**

***She swallows, glances back at the dark house, and forces the words out.***

***“There is a… a monster in our house. Mother and Father locked it in the basement, but… but we can still hear it. Our baby brother is inside. They… they left him in there.”***

***Thorn sniffles loudly, rubbing his eyes with a dirty sleeve.***

***Thorn (softly):*** **“We’re not allowed to go inside when the monster’s awake.”**

**Acting notes:**
- For Rose, keep your voice steady but strained, as if she is determined not to cry.
- For Thorn, let your voice wobble and sniff often.

**Prompt players:**
- **“What do you say to the children?”**

**Likely player questions & Rose/Thorn’s answers:**

1. **“What kind of monster?”**  
   - Rose: **“We… we don’t know. We hear it roaring and scraping the floors. The servants whisper about it, but they won’t tell us what it is.”**

2. **“Where are your parents?”**  
   - Rose: **“They went downstairs to deal with the monster. They told us to stay outside and not to open the door for anyone… but they’ve been gone so long.”**

3. **“Where is your baby brother?”**  
   - Rose: **“In the nursery, on the third floor. Please, he’ll be so scared.”**

4. **“Is anyone else inside?”**  
   - Rose: **“The nursemaid… maybe the servants. But we haven’t seen them.”**

5. **“Why don’t you go in yourselves?”**  
   - Thorn (panicked): **“We’re not allowed! The monster will hear us! Please don’t make us go back in!”**

   - Rose (quickly, protective): **“We’ll wait out here. Just… please, make sure baby Walter is all right.”**

If the party seems hesitant or suspicious, Rose can add:

- **“We can’t pay you much… but Father has money. And jewelry. In the house.”**

This hints at **loot** to motivate reluctant adventurers.

### 6.3 DM Guidance & Hook Strength

Make the offer very clear:

Say to the players in your own voice (not as an NPC):

- **“These children are asking you to go into their house, find their baby brother on the third floor, and deal with the monster in the basement. This is the ‘Death House’ introductory adventure. If you go inside, the story continues there.”**

If they still refuse, see **Section 14 – Optional Side Hooks** for ways to re‑track them back here or offer alternate entrances into Death House.

---

The next writer pass will expand Sections 7–12 to fully script Death House room‑by‑room, including all required elements (encounters, saving throws, loot, Strahd triggers, and interaction prompts).
