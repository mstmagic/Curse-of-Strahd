# 1. Into the Mists & Death House – Novice DM Script

> This file is written for a brand‑new, nervous Dungeon Master who is not a strong actor. You are expected to **read this text out loud**, almost word‑for‑word. You can always improvise, but you never *have* to. When in doubt, just read.
>
> This chapter assumes the characters are **level 1** and will reach **level 3** by the end of Death House.

---

## 1.1. How to Use This File

**Read this section quietly to yourself before the game, not out loud to the players.**

1. This file covers:
   - The party’s arrival in the **Mists of Barovia**.
   - The **Death House** optional adventure.
2. Everything is written in order. Follow the headings in order unless the text clearly says "Optional."
3. Blocks labeled **NARRATION – READ ALOUD** are for you to read almost exactly.
4. Blocks labeled **NPC DIALOG – READ ALOUD** are what an NPC says.
5. Blocks labeled **DM ASIDE** are notes for you; do **not** read them aloud.
6. **PROMPTS** tell you when to ask the players what they do.
7. **SILENCE PROMPTS** remind you to stop talking and let the players react.
8. Rules such as **Saving Throws**, **Encounters**, and **Battlefield Layouts** are clearly marked.

At any time, if you feel lost, you can say to your players:

> “Give me a second to check my notes; this place is complicated.”

Then read ahead for a moment. That is normal and acceptable.

---

## 2. Entering the Mists (Level 1)

This is the very beginning of your Curse of Strahd campaign. The exact way the characters get to the mists can vary (they might be traveling, guarding a caravan, hunting a monster, etc.). You only need one thing: they are **together**, in the **Material Plane**, and **a mysterious fog begins to surround them**.

> **DM ASIDE – Tone & Lore**  
> Barovia is a closed domain ruled by **Strahd von Zarovich**, a vampire lord cursed by dark powers. The mists are how his realm steals people from other worlds. The mists are **not natural fog**. They are cold, suffocating, and malicious. The players should feel uneasy and watched.

### 2.1. The First Hint of Fog

**NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**

> The day begins like any other. The sky above you is a dull gray, with the sun hiding somewhere behind a blanket of cloud. A damp chill hangs in the air, clinging to your clothes and armor. 
>
> As you walk, you notice a faint white mist gathering at ground level, curling around your boots like pale fingers. At first, it’s easy to ignore—a trick of the weather, perhaps—but every minute, the mist thickens. It creeps between roots and stones, slides over the path ahead, and slowly eats away at the horizon.
>
> The air grows colder. Your breath begins to show in front of you in thin, ghostly streams.

**PROMPT (OPEN‑ENDED):**

> “What do you do?”

**Most Likely Player Responses & DM Responses:**

- **Player:** “I keep walking; it’s just fog.”  
  **DM:** “You press on. The mist coils thicker around your legs. Within a few dozen steps, the world beyond thirty feet fades to a shapeless gray. Trees, rocks, and the path itself seem to melt into haze.”

- **Player:** “I try to leave the fog / go back the way we came.”  
  **DM:** “You turn around and retrace your steps. For a while, it feels right, but then you realize the ground looks…familiar. The same gnarled tree. The same split rock. The fog doesn’t thin behind you—it grows denser, like a curtain that you can’t pull aside. After another few minutes, you’re no closer to escaping. The mist seems to shift with you, herding you along.”

- **Player:** “I climb something to look above the fog.”  
  **DM:** “You find a raised spot—a rock, low hill, or tree trunk—and try to get above the mist. You rise three, six, ten feet, but the fog rises with you, like it’s glued to the world. Above you is only a pale, washed‑out sky, with no clear sun and no clear direction. You feel a tightness in your chest as if something doesn’t want you to see where you are.”

**SILENCE PROMPT:**

> Stop talking for 5–10 seconds. Let the players discuss and react.

### 2.2. The Mist Tightens Its Grip

After the players try a few things, move the scene forward.

**NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**

> Time becomes slippery. It’s hard to say whether an hour has passed or ten minutes. The only constant is the mist, which swirls and gathers until it surrounds you on all sides like a living wall of pale gray.
>
> Every sound feels muffled. Your footsteps are dull, your armor is quiet, your own breathing sounds as though it’s coming from a long way off. The air smells of wet earth, old leaves, and something faintly metallic—like a distant hint of blood.
>
> The temperature drops further. A numbness creeps into your fingers.

**PROMPT (CLOSED‑ENDED):**

> “Do you keep moving forward, or do you stop and make camp or preparations?”

If they **keep moving**:

- **DM:** “You push on through the choking mist, each step a little heavier than the last.”

If they **stop or camp**:

- **NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**
  
  > You stop and try to gather yourselves—sharing warmth, checking gear, maybe saying a quiet prayer or curse to your gods. But the mist does not respect your pause. It creeps in closer, swallowing the world in all directions until there is nothing but a sphere of pale gray, no more than thirty feet across, in which you all stand.
  >
  > Outside that faint boundary, there is only blank, suffocating whiteness.

Then continue.

### 2.3. The Voice of the Mists (Strahd’s First Optional Touch)

> **Campaign Trigger – Optional Strahd Interaction #1**  
> Use this if you want Strahd to be felt very early. He does **not** appear physically. His presence is a whisper carried by the mists.

**NARRATION – READ ALOUD (Optional):**

> For a moment, the mist around you seems to still. Your ears pop, as if from a change in air pressure, and then you hear a voice—not with your ears, exactly, but somewhere deeper inside your head.
>
> It is smooth, cultured, and heavy with an old, weary amusement.
>
> “So, more wanderers stumble into my realm,” the voice purrs. “Come, then. Let us see what you are made of before the mists bury your bones.”
>
> As suddenly as it came, the sensation vanishes, leaving behind only the beating of your own hearts.

**NPC Acting Notes – Strahd’s Disembodied Voice:**

- **Voice:** Low, controlled, faintly amused. Slight Eastern European or Romanian accent if you can manage it, but don’t force it. Think: aristocratic, calm predator.
- **Pace:** Speak **slowly**, with long pauses between phrases. He never rushes.
- **Emotion:** Detached curiosity, like a scientist examining an insect. No loud anger yet–only amusement.

**SILENCE PROMPT:**

> Say nothing for at least 5 seconds while the players react.

**Most Likely Player Responses & DM Responses:**

- **Player:** “Did we all hear that?”  
  **DM:** “Yes. Every one of you felt the voice in your mind, as clearly as if it were whispered in your ear.”

- **Player:** “I yell into the fog: ‘Who are you?’”  
  **DM (as Strahd – Optional):**
  
  > **NPC DIALOG – STRAHD, READ ALOUD (Optional):**  
  > A low, indulgent chuckle seems to ripple through the mist.  
  > “Names are for the living… but you may call me **your host**.”  
  > The chuckle fades, and the mists fall silent once more.

- **Player:** “I try to banish the fog / cast a spell on it.”  
  **DM:** “You reach for your magic, will, or faith, and push it into the fog. For a heartbeat, you feel resistance—like pressing against a great weight—but the mist does not part. It swirls, uncaring, as if mocking your effort.”

---

## 3. Emerging in Barovia

Eventually, the mists **spit the characters out** into Barovia proper.

### 3.1. The Edge of the Svalich Woods

**NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**

> The mist ahead of you begins to thin, not all at once, but in reluctant swirls. You see the suggestion of trees first—dark, skeletal trunks reaching like black claws into the sky.
>
> Step by step, the fog loosens its grip. You find yourselves on a crude dirt road, rutted with old wagon tracks and choked by wet leaves. On either side of the road, ancient trees crowd close, their branches knitting together overhead to form a tangled, oppressive canopy that blocks most of the gray light.
>
> The smell of the air has changed. Gone is the metallic tang; instead, there is the dank odor of rotting leaves, wet bark, and distant woodsmoke—or is that your imagination?
>
> Somewhere in the forest, a single raven caws, the sound sharp and lonely in the stillness.

**DM ASIDE – Lore:**  
You are now in the **Svalich Woods**, on the Old Svalich Road that leads to the **Village of Barovia**. The sun is weak and pale, permanently dimmed by the cursed nature of the valley. There is no bright daylight here.

**PROMPT (OPEN‑ENDED):**

> “What do you do?”

**Likely Player Responses:**

- **Follow the road.**  
  **DM:** “You follow the muddy road deeper into the forest. The trees press close, and the sky above remains a dull, lifeless gray.”

- **Leave the road, walk into the woods.**  
  **DM:** “You push into the undergrowth. The earth is soft and wet beneath your boots, and every branch seems to claw at your clothes. After a few minutes, you find yourself turned around. The road hides itself easily. You can try to find it again with a Survival check.”

  - **Survival DC 12:** If a character attempts this, ask for a roll.
    - **Success:** “With some effort, you reorient yourselves and manage to return to the road, branches scratching against your armor as if the forest resents losing you.”
    - **Failure:** “You wander for several long minutes. The trees all look the same, their trunks twisted in almost human shapes. Just as a sliver of panic begins to creep in, you stumble back onto the very same dirt road, as if it had simply been waiting beneath your feet all along.”

**SILENCE PROMPT:**

> Pause again. Let them decide their direction. If they hesitate too long, you can gently say: “You hear the faint creak of wood somewhere ahead along the road, like an old sign swinging in the wind.”

### 3.2. The Distant Cry (Optional Strahd Interaction #2)

> **Optional:** Use this if you want another subtle sign of Strahd’s presence early, but still no physical appearance.

**NARRATION – READ ALOUD (Optional):**

> As you move along the road, a sudden chill wind pushes through the trees, making branches groan and creak. For an instant, carried on that wind, you think you hear a faint, agonized cry—half human, half something else. It’s gone almost as soon as you notice it, swallowed by the whispering leaves.

**DM ASIDE:**  
If players investigate, they find nothing—just dark trees and the suggestion of shapes in the shadows. This is only to reinforce how haunted this land feels.

---

## 4. The Death House Hook (Level 1 → 3)

> **Lore Accuracy Note:** Death House is an **optional** haunted‑house mini‑dungeon in the official adventure, meant to level low‑level characters safely before they face the wider dangers of Barovia. In this campaign, you will use it as the **first major location** after entering the valley.

The party now approaches the outskirts of the **Village of Barovia**. Before they fully enter the village, they will encounter **the Death House children**: Rose and Thorn.

### 4.1. Approaching the Village of Barovia

**NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**

> The oppressive forest finally begins to thin. The trees retreat a little from the road, and through the gaps you see shapes—buildings, clustered together like huddled animals. 
>
> A village lies ahead, its houses tall and narrow, their steep roofs sagging under the weight of years. Most of the windows are dark, their shutters closed like lidded, watching eyes. A chill wind snakes through the street, carrying with it the smell of damp wood, chimney smoke, and something sour and stale, like old wine left too long in the cask.
>
> There are very few people outside. In fact, at first glance, you don’t see **anyone**. The only sounds are the creak of a distant sign, the caw of a raven on a nearby rooftop, and the faint drip‑drip‑drip of water from an overflowing gutter.

**PROMPT (OPEN‑ENDED):**

> “You stand at the edge of this gloomy village. What do you do?”

Let them discuss exploring, looking for an inn, or calling out.

If they **call out or make noise**:

- **NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**
  
  > Your voice echoes weakly down the empty street. A curtain in a nearby window twitches, just a fraction, then falls still again. Somewhere farther into the village, a dog lets out a single bark, then goes quiet.

If they **move deeper into the village**, continue.

### 4.2. The Children in the Mist

Death House begins when the party encounters two children outside a suspicious townhouse.

**NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**

> As you proceed along the street, a thin trail of mist curls at ground level, thicker here than before. It gathers especially around a particular tall townhouse of gray stone, its facade staring down at you with dark, blank windows.
>
> In front of the house, near a wrought iron gate, stand two children—a girl and a younger boy. The girl wears a faded, once‑fine dress and clutches a small doll in her hands. The boy hugs himself and shivers, his eyes wide.
>
> The wind tugs at their clothes and hair, but they stand very still, like figures in a painting.

**NPCs Introduced:**

- **Rosavalda “Rose” Durst** – Age 10, the older sister.
- **Thornboldt “Thorn” Durst** – Age 7, the younger brother.

**How to Play Rose:**

- **Voice:** Soft but composed for a child; she tries to sound braver than she feels.
- **Tone:** Polite, proper, slightly distant. She’s used to being told what to do.
- **Mannerisms:** Keeps a tight grip on her doll, glances nervously at the house, then back to the party. Stands protectively near Thorn.

**How to Play Thorn:**

- **Voice:** Quieter, stammering at times. Afraid and on the verge of tears.
- **Tone:** Scared, dependent on Rose. Hesitates before speaking.
- **Mannerisms:** Clings to Rose’s dress; rubs his eyes; flinches at loud sounds.

**NPC DIALOG – ROSE, READ ALOUD (First Line):**

> “E‑excuse me,” the girl says, her voice barely carrying over the wind. “Can you help us? There’s… there’s a monster in our house.”

**SILENCE PROMPT:**

> Stop and let the players respond to the children.

**Most Likely Player Questions & Your Answers (In Character):**

1. **“What kind of monster?”**  
   - **Rose:**
     
     > “We don’t know what it looks like. We just hear it… roaring. From the basement. Mother and Father told us to stay outside while they deal with it, but…”

2. **“Where are your parents?”**  
   - **Rose:**
     
     > “Inside. They went down to the basement… a while ago.”  
     > She glances back at the house.  
     > “They haven’t come back.”

3. **“Is anyone else in the house?”**  
   - **Rose:**
     
     > “Our baby brother, Walter. He’s in his room on the third floor. We’re… we’re not allowed to go back in.”

4. **“Why can’t you go back in?”**  
   - **Rose (uneasy):**
     
     > “Mother said it wasn’t safe until the monster is gone.”

5. **“How long have you been out here?”**  
   - **Rose (avoids the question):**
     
     > “Please. Walter is still inside. Will you help us?”

**DM ASIDE – Their True Nature (Do NOT read aloud):**  
Rose and Thorn are actually **spirits**, tied to the Death House. They are not alive, but the party doesn’t know this yet. Play them as real, frightened children.

### 4.3. Guiding the Party into Death House

If the party **agrees to help**:

**NPC DIALOG – ROSE, READ ALOUD:**

> Rose’s shoulders sag with visible relief.  
> “Thank you,” she says. “Thank you so much. The front door is unlocked.”  
> She points to the house behind her, then adds, almost apologetically,  
> “We’re not supposed to go back in… but you’re heroes. You can.”

**NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**

> The children step aside, allowing you access to the wrought iron gate and the front door beyond. The house looms over you now—a tall, grim structure of gray stone and dark wood, its windows like empty eye sockets staring into the street.

If the party **refuses or hesitates strongly**:

- **NPC DIALOG – THORN, READ ALOUD:**
  
  > The little boy’s lower lip trembles. “Please don’t leave us,” he whispers. “We’ll be all alone. The monster will come out. It will find us.”

- **DM ASIDE:** Most good‑aligned characters will relent. If they insist on walking away, the mists can begin to thicken again down the street, guiding them back, or you can have another Barovian villager mention “the Durst house” as a source of trouble.

> **Optional Side Hook – Re‑Tracking the Story:**  
> If the party ignores the children and starts to wander the village, you may use an NPC (a frightened villager at a window, or an old woman sweeping a step) to say something like:  
> “If you value your souls, don’t go near that cursed Durst house. Or better—if you’re as strong as you look, maybe you *should* go. That place has been a blight on us for years.”  
> This can gently nudge them back toward Death House.

---

## 5. Exterior of the Death House

> **Lore Note:** The Death House is an old townhouse owned by the Durst family, who worshiped dread entities in secret. The house itself is an extension of a cult‑haunted dungeon beneath it. It appears normal(ish) at first, then becomes increasingly nightmarish.

### 5.1. Describing the House

**NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**

> The tall house has a steep, gabled roof and gray stone walls streaked with age and grime. Its iron gate hangs slightly askew, squeaking softly as the wind pushes it back and forth. 
>
> The front door is a heavy slab of dark wood, carved with ornate scrollwork—vines, flowers, and children dancing in a ring. The carvings are chipped and weather‑worn, but still strangely beautiful. Above the door hangs a shield‑shaped crest emblazoned with a stylized windmill.
>
> All the windows are dark. No light, no movement, nothing but the faint reflection of the cloudy sky.

**PROMPT (OPEN‑ENDED):**

> “You stand before the front door of the house. What do you do?”

Likely actions:

- **Check the door for traps / listen.**  
  - **Perception DC 12:** No traps, faint creaking inside (house settling).  
  - **Investigation DC 12:** Confirm it appears mundane, just old.
- **Call inside.**  
  - No response, only hollow echoes.
- **Open the door.**  
  - Proceed to the Entrance Hall.

**SILENCE PROMPT:**

> Let them decide how cautious or bold they want to be.

---

## 6. Inside Death House – General Notes

> **DM ASIDE – Very Important:**  
> The official book describes Death House room by room. This script keeps the same map and layout, but gives you step‑by‑step narration, dialog, and prompts. Do not worry if you don’t remember every secret; this script will walk you through the likely path.

**Tone for the Whole House:**

- Oppressive, tense, elegant‑but‑rotting.  
- Smell: Dust, old wood, faint incense, something sour underneath.
- Sound: Floorboards creak, wind rattles shutters, occasional distant sob or whisper (most of these are house illusions).

**General Strahd Interactions (Optional):**

Within Death House, Strahd does **not** typically appear physically, but you may add:

- A brief **whisper in a mirror**.  
- A **raven tapping** at a window that seems to watch the party.  
- A cold wind that feels like an unseen presence circling them.

Always keep Strahd distant, entertained, and curious at this early stage.

---

## 7. Area 1: Entrance Hall (1st Floor)

### 7.1. Entering the Hall

When the players open the front door, read:

**NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**

> The door opens with a low, drawn‑out creak, like a reluctant sigh. Beyond is a wide hall with dark wood paneling, polished to a dull sheen. A black‑and‑white checkered marble floor stretches before you, reflecting the weak light that spills in from the empty street behind you.
>
> Straight ahead, a grand red‑carpeted staircase climbs to the upper floors. On the walls hang portraits in gilded frames: stern men and women in fine clothes, their painted eyes following you with unsettling realism.
>
> A long coat rack stands near the door, holding a few old cloaks and walking sticks, all coated with a thin layer of dust.

**PROMPT (OPEN‑ENDED):**

> “You step into the entrance hall of the house. What do you do?”

Likely actions:

- Inspect paintings
- Search for other doors
- Call out for the parents or Walter

### 7.2. Interacting with the Hall

**If they inspect the paintings:**

- **NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**
  
  > The portraits show what appears to be several generations of a well‑to‑do family. In more recent paintings, you recognize the townhouse’s very facade behind them. The later portraits show a couple with two children—a girl and a younger boy—who bear more than a passing resemblance to the children outside.

**If they call out:**

- **NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**
  
  > Your voices echo dully around the hall, swallowed by the wooden walls and the high ceiling. No one answers.

**If they look for other exits:**  
There are doors leading deeper into the house. On this floor, the likely path is:

- **Door to the right of the entrance** – leads to the **Dining Room**.
- **Door to the left** – leads to a **Closet** or **Kitchen area** depending on the exact map you’re using. (Use the official Death House map here.)

**DM ASIDE – Player Agency:**  
Let them choose where to go first. There is no single correct order, but they will eventually need to ascend to reach the upper floors and, later, the secret basement.

---

## 8. Area 2: The Dining Room (1st Floor)

> **DM NOTE:** This section assumes they choose the dining room next. If they go elsewhere, you can skip here when appropriate.

### 8.1. First Impressions

**NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**

> You open the door and step into an elegant dining room. A long, polished mahogany table dominates the chamber, surrounded by high‑backed chairs with carved, clawed legs. The table is set with gleaming silverware and fine crystal goblets, all carefully arranged as though a grand dinner were expected at any moment.
>
> A crystal chandelier hangs over the table, its many facets catching what little light there is and throwing pale reflections on the dark paneled walls. The air smells faintly of dust and old, cold candles.
>
> On one wall, a stone fireplace holds the remnants of burned logs. Above the mantle hangs a large, framed painting of a windmill set atop a rocky hill, silhouetted against a stormy sky.

**PROMPT (OPEN‑ENDED):**

> “The dining room appears untouched by time, as if awaiting guests who never arrived. What do you do?”

### 8.2. Searching the Dining Room – Loot & Details

**If they examine the tableware:**

- **NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**
  
  > The silverware and crystal are of fine make. Each fork and knife bears the same windmill crest you saw above the front door. Despite the dust, everything here could be worth real coin to the right buyer.

- **Loot:**  
  - **Set of silverware & crystal:** Total worth **50 gp** if safely transported and sold in a major town (not in Barovia village; here you might get only **10–15 gp equivalent** in trade due to poverty and fear).

**If they examine the painting above the fireplace:**

- **NARRATION – READ ALOUD:**
  
  > The painting shows a lonely windmill perched on a rocky rise, its sails frozen in a moment of motion against dark, rolling clouds. There is something unsettling about the proportions—too tall, too thin, looming. At the base of the hill, tiny indistinct figures seem to trudge along a crooked path.

> **DM ASIDE – Lore Tie‑In:**  
> This painting foreshadows **Old Bonegrinder**, the windmill in Chapter 6 of the main book. Players may remember it later.

**PROMPT (CLOSED‑ENDED):**

> “Do you take anything from the room, or just examine and move on?”

If they **take valuable items**:

- **DM ASIDE:** Note this for later moral weight. The house is cursed; taking things doesn’t curse them further, but it emphasizes their willingness to loot.

**SILENCE PROMPT:**

> Pause, let them debate looting vs. respect.

---

## 9. Ongoing Structure & Next Steps

This file has brought you:

1. From entering the Mists to arriving in Barovia.  
2. Through the initial hook for Death House (the children).  
3. Into the first rooms (Entrance Hall and Dining Room) with full narration, NPC guidance, prompts, and loot.

> **DM ASIDE:**  
> To keep this response within length limits, the rest of Death House (upper floors, nursery, secret stairways, basement, cult areas, shambling mound, leveling instructions, and additional Strahd interaction points) should be added as further numbered sections in this same file, continuing the style above:
> - 10. First‑Floor Parlor & Den  
> - 11. Second Floor – Balcony, Library, Conservatory  
> - 12. Third Floor – Nursemaid’s Suite & Secret Nursery  
> - 13. Attic – Children’s Room & Hidden Stair  
> - 14. Dungeon Level – Cult Quarters  
> - 15. Ritual Chamber & Final Encounter  
> - 16. Escaping the House & Leveling to 3  
> - 17. Optional Strahd Appearances & Side Adventures to Re‑Track the Party

If you’d like, I can continue this exact format in subsequent updates, expanding each remaining Death House area with:
- Room‑by‑room narration
- Full dialog for ghosts, cultists, and illusions
- Battle layouts, saving throws, and DCs
- Multiple optional Strahd touchpoints
- Optional mini‑quests inside and around the house to pull wandering players back on track.
