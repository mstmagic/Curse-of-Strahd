# 1. Death House – Interior, Upper Floors (Part 1)

> This file assumes you have already run:
> - `02-Into-the-Mists-Scene-By-Scene.md`
> - `03-Death-House-Exterior.md`
> - `04-Death-House-Interior-Ground-Floor.md`
>
> The characters should currently be **inside the Death House**, having explored most or all of the **ground floor**. They are roughly **level 2** (if you are using milestone leveling, they can level up after fully surviving the ground floor or upon reaching the second floor landing, at your preference).

---

## 2. Orientation for the Dungeon Master

1. **Scope of this file**
   1. Covers the **transition from the ground floor to the second floor**, the **second-floor hall**, and a selection of the **key rooms** on the second floor.
   2. All text is written for you to **read or paraphrase verbatim**.
   3. This part focuses on **slow-burn horror, atmosphere, and tension**, with limited combat.

2. **Tone and Lore Accuracy**
   1. Keep everything **gothic, oppressive, and tragic**, not goofy or heroic.
   2. The house is an **extension of Strahd’s Domain of Dread**, but Death House itself belongs to the **Durst family cult**, not Strahd directly.
   3. Strahd’s presence is **felt more than seen** here, through shadows, ravens, the mists, and the sense of a watching intelligence.

3. **When to Level the Characters**
   1. If they started Death House at level 1, most tables level them to **level 2** either:
      - After a full ground floor exploration, or
      - As they **reach the second-floor landing**, marking deeper entrapment.
   2. If you choose to level here, **give them a short rest narration** (provided later) and then let them adjust their sheets.

4. **Using This as a Map-Pinned Script**
   1. Each numbered section below can be **pinned to the relevant map area**.
   2. When the players move their tokens there, **read the narration** and then follow the **dialogue / prompts / likely responses**.

---

## 3. Transition: Climbing from Ground Floor to Second Floor

Use this the **first time** the party goes up the main staircase from the ground floor hall.

### 3.1 Narration – The Staircase Deepens the Gloom

Read slowly:

> The polished wooden staircase rises along the wall, its banister carved with crawling vines and tiny flowers strangling each other for space. Each step gives a soft, complaining creak under your weight, as if the house itself resents you climbing higher.
>
> The air grows cooler with every step. The faint lamplight from the ground floor withers behind you, swallowed by a grayness that smells faintly of old incense, dust, and something like dried roses left too long in a sealed room.
>
> Your footsteps echo in this tight, wooden throat of the house, and for a moment you could swear you hear a second set of steps that stop whenever you stop.

Pause. Let the players react.

**Silence Prompt:**
- Say nothing for **5–10 seconds**. Let them fill the silence with their own paranoia.

### 3.2 Player Prompts

Ask:

> As you climb, who is in the front, and who brings up the rear?

Then:

> Are you moving quietly and cautiously, or just heading up at a normal pace?

Let them answer. If they say they’re being stealthy:
- Have them roll **Stealth checks** (group check). DC **10–12** is fine for this passage; success mainly affects **how you describe sounds**.

If they roll well:

> Your boots fall more softly on the polished wood. The house still creaks, but it feels less like you are intruding and more like something is simply… breathing around you.

If they roll poorly:

> The staircase protests every step with groans and squeals. Dust shivers loose from the ceiling, raining down in lazy gray motes that catch in your throats and eyes.

### 3.3 Optional Minor Haunt – Watching Eyes

You may trigger this **once** on the way up if you want an extra chill. No mechanics, just mood.

> For a heartbeat, as your lantern or torch swings, the carved vines and flowers seem to twist. The knots in the dark wood resolve into staring faces – hollow-eyed, open-mouthed, as if mid-scream. Then they’re just knots again.

**Closed prompt:**

> Do you ignore it and keep going, or stop to take a closer look at the woodwork?

If they look closer:

> You lean in. The wood smells of polish, oil, and old, stale smoke. Your fingers brush over lacquered vines and petals, perfectly ordinary under your touch. If there were faces here, they’re gone now.

**Open prompt:**

> What do you do?

---

## 4. Second-Floor Landing Overview

This corresponds to the **second-floor hall** of Death House.

### 4.1 Narration – Arriving on the Second Floor

> The staircase opens onto a dark hallway running the width of the house. Framed portraits and landscapes hang crooked on the walls, their varnish cracked like aged skin. A red-patterned runner muffles your steps, its edges frayed and stiff with dust.
>
> Oil lamps fitted with frosted-glass globes cling to the walls like pale, bloated insects. Their light is dim and yellowed, making every shadow look too long.
>
> Ahead, several doors stand shut, their brass handles dulled with fingerprints and time. A single door near the stairs stands slightly ajar, a bar of darkness cutting into the hall like a wound.

**Silence Prompt:**
- Let this land. Give the players a long pause to discuss.

### 4.2 Basic Hall Description (For Quick Reminders)

You can summarize if players revisit:

> You stand in a long, dim hall. Old portraits, dim lamps, and several closed doors. The runner muffles your steps.

### 4.3 Acting Notes – The House Itself

- **Voice:** When you speak as the *house*, keep your voice **low, patient, indifferent**, as if the house does not care if they live or die.
- **Rhythm:** Use **slow pacing** and **frequent pauses**. The fear comes from what you don’t say.
- **Body language:** Hunch slightly, fold your arms, or lean forward when describing details, as if drawing players into a secret.

### 4.4 Likely Player Actions and DM Responses

1. **They look at the portraits.**
   - Narrate:

     > The portraits show a well-to-do Barovian family – the same faces you saw on the ground floor, in the entrance hall. A man with a sharp beard and harder eyes, a severe but handsome woman, and two children. Their painted smiles never quite reach their eyes.

   - If they ask who the people are:

     > You don’t see any names on the frames. The style matches the house: proud, expensive, and just a little cruel.

   - **Optional Insight check (DC 10–12):**
     - On success: they sense the family is **more concerned with status than warmth**.

2. **They check for traps or listen at doors.**
   - **Perception or Investigation** as appropriate (DC 13–15) – mostly to find small details.
   - You can reward a good roll with added eerie details (distant child’s laughter, slight draft from under a door, etc.).

3. **They call out or announce themselves.**
   - Use this to emphasize isolation:

     > Your voices disappear down the hall, swallowed by curtains and carpets. For a long moment, there’s no answer at all.

   - **Optional Strahd-tinged moment:**

     > Then, so faint you can’t tell if it’s real, you think you hear a man’s low chuckle carried on a draft, as if someone far away finds your courage amusing.

4. **They hesitate, unsure where to go.**
   - Use a gentle prompt:

     > Several doors wait in the dim light: one slightly ajar near the stairs, others closed farther down the hall. The air feels heavy, as if the house is holding its breath. Where do you go?

---

## 5. Door Near the Stairs – The Nursemaid’s Suite (Approach Only)

In this **Part 1** file, we’ll **lead them up to** the nursemaid’s suite and start the encounter, but save the **full combat details** for a later part if you prefer. However, you can still run the encounter entirely from this file if needed.

### 5.1 Approaching the Ajar Door

This is the **first obvious place** they may go.

> The nearest door, just a few steps from the top of the stairs, stands open a finger’s width. No light comes from within. The gap is a vertical line of blackness.

**Prompt:**

> Who goes to the door, and how do you open it – slowly, or just push it in?

If they **listen first**:
- Have them roll **Perception, DC 13**.
  - On success:

    > You hear nothing living – just the faint creak of wood shifting, and somewhere in the distance, a soft rhythmic noise like something lightly tapping against glass.

  - On failure:

    > All you hear is the blood in your own ears and the hushed breathing of your companions.

### 5.2 Entering the Nursemaid’s Suite – Initial View

When they open the door and look in:

> The door swings open on oiled hinges, silent as a breath. Beyond is a cozy, well-appointed bedroom draped in shadows. A large bed with a carved headboard dominates the far wall, its once-fine coverlet now dusty but neatly made. Heavy curtains hang over the windows, blocking whatever passes for daylight in this place.
>
> To one side stands a wardrobe with mirrored doors, its reflection showing the room in warped, yellowed glass. A small table holds the remains of a silver-backed brush set, a hand mirror, and a stoppered perfume bottle crusted with residue.
>
> The air smells of old perfume and stale linen, with an undercurrent of something sour, like milk left out too long.

**Silence Prompt:**
- Let them describe where they go in the room.

### 5.3 NPC: The Ghostly Nursemaid (Setup)

Lore: The nursemaid was **the Durst family’s servant and secret mistress**, murdered along with her child when the cult was cleaning up its secrets. Her spirit is **sad, protective, and afraid**, but can be provoked into violence.

**How to voice and play her (before she manifests fully):**
- **Voice:** Soft, distant, slightly echoing. Imagine you’re speaking from another room or down a hallway.
- **Emotion:** Worn-out grief. She is **tired of being angry**, but the anger is still there.
- **Pace:** Slow, with long pauses, as though she struggles to remember words.

You don’t reveal her immediately. Use **light manifestations** first.

### 5.4 Likely Player Actions in the Suite

1. **They search the room casually.**
   - Have them roll **Perception or Investigation, DC 12–14**.
   - On a basic success:

     > You find dust, old linens, and small personal items. This room belonged to someone of middling status – not the lady of the house, but someone who lived comfortably in their shadow.

   - On a higher roll (15+):

     > Beneath the dust, you notice faint indentations on the floorboards near the bed, like the regular path of someone wearing heeled shoes, pacing from bed to door, bed to door, over and over.

2. **They look in the wardrobe.**
   - Narrate:

     > The wardrobe opens with a soft sigh of wood. Inside hang a few faded dresses, their colors long since bled away into gray. The fabric is brittle to the touch.

   - **Optional minor scare:** When they look into the mirrored doors:

     > For a moment, as you catch your reflection in the spotted mirror, there is someone standing just behind you – a young woman in a plain but neat dress, her hair pinned back, her eyes heavy with sleeplessness. She vanishes when you turn.

   - **Closed prompt:**

     > Do you spin around, weapon ready, or keep staring into the mirror?

3. **They inspect the vanity table.**
   - Narrate:

     > The silver brush and comb are tarnished, but well-made. Someone once cared a great deal about appearances here. The perfume bottle is cloudy, its contents long gone bitter.

   - **Loot:**
     - Silver brush, comb, and hand mirror set, worth **25 gp total** if sold in a proper market (in Barovia, practical resale value is often **half or less** – NPCs are poor and desperate).

   - If they ask about prices in Barovia:

     > Out in Barovia proper, most common folk rarely see a single gold piece. Trinkets like this might fetch half their normal value, maybe less, unless you find a collector or a noble with a taste for such things.

4. **They call out, “Is anyone here?”**
   - This is a good time to **let the nursemaid’s spirit respond faintly**, without full manifestation yet.

   - In a low, distant voice, say:

     > “Shh… you’ll wake the baby…”

   - Let that hang in the air.

   - **Silence Prompt:**
     - Say nothing for several seconds. Wait for the players to react.

   - If they respond, have her say only one or two short lines:

     - If they ask, “Where are you?”

       > “Here… and not. I mustn’t leave. They said… they said I had to watch…”

     - If they ask, “Watch what?”

       > “The child. Always the child. Even when there is no crying anymore.”

---

## 6. The Nursery Door

Connected to the nursemaid’s suite is a smaller adjoining room – the **nursery**.

### 6.1 Noticing the Door

If they explore the room, eventually point this out:

> Set into the wall beside the wardrobe, half-hidden behind a hanging robe, you spot a smaller wooden door. The paint around its edges is smudged and worn smooth by many hands, as if it’s been opened and closed countless times.

**Prompt:**

> The little door seems to lead to a smaller chamber. Who approaches it, and what do you do?

If they hesitate or seem spooked, use:

> The faint scent of sour milk and old powder seems stronger near this door.

### 6.2 Entering the Nursery – Narration

When they open the nursery door, read:

> The door opens on squealing hinges into a cramped nursery. A tiny crib with high, narrow bars stands in the middle of the room, its canopy of lace sagging like old cobwebs. A mobile of little wooden ravens hangs above it, still and dust-choked.
>
> A small rocking chair sits in one corner, facing the crib. It rocks once, very slightly, as though someone just stood up from it.
>
> The air in here is colder than the bedroom, and it smells thickly of dust and something faintly metallic, like old blood that’s been scrubbed and scrubbed but never quite left.

**Silence Prompt:**
- Do not speak for a few seconds after this description. Let players choose how to proceed.

### 6.3 Likely Player Actions in the Nursery

1. **They look into the crib.**
   - If they are cautious:

     > You lean over the crib. Inside, under a thin, moth-eaten blanket, you see the tiny form of a baby-shaped bundle. It doesn’t move.

   - If they pull back the blanket:

     > Beneath the blanket is a small bundle of rotted cloth wrapped around nothing but brittle sticks and rags. Someone fashioned a crude, decaying doll to lie here – a replacement, or a denial.

   - **Optional Wisdom (Insight) DC 10–12:**
     - On success:

       > Whoever did this was trying to pretend there was still a baby to care for. A ritual of denial, repeated again and again.

2. **They examine the rocking chair.**
   - Narrate:

     > The rocking chair is sized for an adult, but worn smooth on the arms where hands once rested for long, sleepless hours. As you watch, it gives a slow, creaking sway, then stops.

   - If they sit in it:

     > As you sit, the wood is cold under you. For a heartbeat, you feel weight settle against your chest, as though a small, unseen child has been placed there. The sensation vanishes almost immediately, leaving behind a faint ache in your ribs.

3. **They inspect the raven mobile.**
   - Narrate:

     > The little wooden ravens are carved crudely but lovingly. Each one has tiny scratched feathers and bead-like eyes. When you touch the mobile, it spins slowly, and the ravens’ shadows slide over the walls like watching shapes.

   - **Optional Omen – Strahd’s Domain:**

     > As the ravens turn, for a moment all their beady eyes seem to look not at you, but past you, toward some unseen point deeper in the house.

4. **They call out or speak gently, trying to soothe the room.**
   - You can reward this kindness with a slightly gentler nursemaid spirit later, or a small clue.

---

## 7. Manifestation of the Nursemaid’s Ghost (Non-Combat)

The official adventure presents the nursemaid as a **specter** that can attack. For this **Part 1**, we focus on a **non-combat, roleplay-first manifestation**. You can escalate to combat later if the players are cruel, aggressive, or insist on provoking her.

### 7.1 Triggering the Manifestation

Trigger the nursemaid’s ghost when **any one** of the following happens:

1. A character **disturbs the crib** aggressively (kicking it, overturning it, mocking it).
2. A character **demands answers loudly**, shouting in the suite or nursery.
3. The group **shows genuine compassion** – for example, gently tucking in the bundle or speaking kindly to the unseen child.

### 7.2 Narration – The Ghost Appears

Read this, speaking softly but clearly:

> The air in the nursery grows suddenly colder, your breath misting in front of your faces. The rocking chair gives a sharp jerk and begins to sway on its own, faster and faster, though no one touches it.
>
> A thin, grayish light seeps from the walls and floorboards, gathering like fog in the center of the room. It rises, twisting, until it takes the shape of a young woman in a plain, long dress, her hair pinned back beneath a simple cap.
>
> Her features are blurred by grief and by death, but you can see the dark hollows where her eyes should be, and the lines of exhaustion etched into her face. Her hands are clasped as if cradling an invisible infant.

**Silence Prompt:**
- After describing her, pause. Do not immediately make her speak.

### 7.3 How to Voice and Play the Nursemaid

- **Voice:** Hushed, tired, with a faint echo, as though coming from the bottom of a well.
- **Manner:** She is **suspicious but not immediately hostile**. She is trapped by duty and guilt.
- **Body Language (for you physically, if you like):** Hunch slightly, clasp your hands as if holding something fragile, rarely make eye contact.

### 7.4 Opening Lines – Nursemaid Dialogue

After a pause, in character, say:

> “Please… you shouldn’t be here. They don’t like strangers… they never did.”

If a player speaks, respond according to their tone.

#### If players are gentle or sympathetic

Example player lines & your responses:

- **Player:** “We don’t mean any harm. Who are you?”
  - **Nursemaid:**
    > “I… I was… in their service. I watched over the children. I tried to keep them safe.”

- **Player:** “Which children? Are they still here?”
  - **Nursemaid:**
    > “Rose and Thorn. My sweet roses in the dark… They cried and no one came. I… I wasn’t allowed…”

- **Player:** “What weren’t you allowed to do?”
  - **Nursemaid:**
    > “Leave this floor. Leave this room. Leave *him*. The master said the ritual was more important than any of us.”

  - If they push for more, she clutches her invisible child tighter.

- **Player:** “Who is ‘the master’?”
  - **Nursemaid:**
    > “Lord Durst. The house bends to his will, even now. Even in death. The walls remember his whispers… and his knives.”

#### If players are aggressive or insulting

- **Player:** “Tell us what’s going on or we’ll put you to rest.”
  - **Nursemaid (voice hardening):**
    > “You think you can end this? You don’t understand this house. It feeds on promises broken and blood spilled. You would only add to the feast.”

- **Player attacks or threatens more:**
  - You may **escalate later** into a combat specter encounter (covered in a later file or at your discretion).

#### If players are confused and ask blunt questions

- **Player:** “How do we get out of this house?”
  - **Nursemaid:**
    > “Down. Always down. The roots of the house are sunk deep. Only there can you cut them. Or be buried among them.”

- **Player:** “Where is the basement?”
  - **Nursemaid:**
    > “Hidden behind their lies. Behind their *pretty* things. The way down is not on this floor. You must go higher first. Then… lower.”

This cryptic hint gently points them toward exploring the **upper levels** fully.

### 7.5 Mechanical Notes – Non-Combat Ghost

- Treat the nursemaid as a **specter** that is currently in a **non-hostile, incorporeal state**.
- She **does not attack** unless:
  1. They **attack her** first.
  2. They **destroy the nursery in a cruel way**.
  3. They **mock or threaten the children**.
- If combat occurs, you can use the **Specter stat block** (from the Monster Manual or the Curse of Strahd appendix) with the usual **incorporeal movement, life drain, etc.**

> If you do **not** want to run combat yet, simply have her **flicker and vanish** if the players become too aggressive.

---

## 8. Player Question Handling – Common Lines and Responses

Below are some **likely questions** and **suggested answers** from the nursemaid or from you as DM through description.

1. **“What happened to the children?”**
   - **Nursemaid:**

     > “They locked them away from the worst of it. Or so they said. But hunger and fear are their own kind of cruelty. Rose tried to be so brave… Thorn just wanted his toys…”

   - If pressed:

     > “Their bodies… I don’t know. I was… taken below before the end. All I know is that their laughter stopped.”

2. **“Why can’t you leave this room?”**
   - **Nursemaid:**

     > “I was bound here. To watch and to guard and to suffer. My shame holds me as tightly as any chain. I should have taken them and run. But where can one run, in this land? The mists swallow everything.”

   - This references **Barovia’s Mists**, tied to Strahd’s domain.

3. **“Is Strahd involved? Do you know him?”**
   - It is important to keep lore accurate: the **Durst cult** worships Strahd, but they are a **separate entity**.

   - **Nursemaid:**

     > “They whispered his name downstairs. Lord of the land. Lord of the night. They said if they pleased him, he would look upon them with favor. I never saw him. I only heard the prayers… and the screams.”

   - This preserves Strahd’s distance and power while tying the house to him thematically.

4. **“Can you help us?”**
   - **Nursemaid:**

     > “I can warn you. The house will not let you go easily. Doors that led out will no longer obey. It will try to drown you in smoke and blood before it lets you see the sky again.”

   - This foreshadows the **Death House finale**.

5. **“What do you want?”**
   - **Nursemaid:**

     > “I want… to hear them laugh again. To know they are somewhere he cannot reach. If you find any trace of them… any bones, any toys… please, don’t leave them down there in the dark.”

   - This gives a **roleplay-driven motive**: returning or consecrating the children’s remains later could calm her spirit.

---

## 9. Optional Strahd-Tinged Atmospheric Beat

This is **not** a physical appearance by Strahd, but a subtle indication that **his will touches this place**.

You may insert this **after** the nursemaid warns them about going “down” or when players mention Strahd repeatedly.

> As the nursemaid speaks the name “Strahd,” every lamp flame in the bedroom and hall gutters low, then flares up a deep, blood-red hue for a heartbeat before returning to their sickly yellow.
>
> For just a moment, a cold, amused voice that is not hers curls at the back of your thoughts: *“Such fragile little ghosts, clinging to old tragedies…”* Then it is gone, like a bad dream.

Do **not** answer questions about this voice clearly. If players ask, “Did we all hear that?” you can respond:

> Your memories don’t quite agree. Some of you remember words, others just a feeling of being watched. Either way, you all feel colder.

This keeps Strahd’s attention **flexible** so you can later choose how often he intrudes.

---

## 10. Exiting the Suite and Nursery

Once the players finish here, they will likely move back into the **second-floor hall**.

### 10.1 If They Leave Peacefully

> As you step back into the hallway, the air seems just a little less cold. The door to the nursery drifts half-closed behind you, as if pushed by a faint draft. For a moment, you think you hear a lullaby hummed in a voice worn thin by grief, then it fades.

### 10.2 If They Angered the Nursemaid but Avoided Combat

> The temperature in the hallway remains bitterly cold as you step out. Behind you, the door to the nursery slams shut with a sharp report that echoes down the hall. When you look back, the doorknob is rimed with frost.

If they try to re-enter later, you may require a **Strength check (DC 14)** to force the frozen door, or just have it remain stubbornly shut unless they make amends later in the house.

---

## 11. Mechanical Summary for This Part

1. **Checks & Saving Throws**
   1. Stealth checks on the staircase (DC 10–12) – flavor only.
   2. Perception/Investigation in the hall and suite (DC 12–15) for extra detail.
   3. Optional Insight checks (DC 10–12) for emotional context.
   4. Strength check (DC 14) if forcing a frozen nursery door (optional consequence).

2. **Encounters**
   1. **Non-combat encounter** with the nursemaid’s ghost (specter).
   2. Potential combat if players attack or grossly provoke her (use specter stat block; typical battlefield is **cramped nursery** and **bedroom**, with difficult movement around furniture).

3. **Battlefield Layout (If Combat Occurs)**
   1. **Nursemaid’s Suite:**
      - Large bed provides **half cover** if someone ducks beside or behind it.
      - Wardrobe and vanity are **lightly obstructing terrain**; can be moved around but not through.
   2. **Nursery:**
      - Crib in the center counts as **difficult terrain** if climbed over.
      - Rocking chair is **light cover** at best.
      - The room is **small**, so area spells can easily catch everyone.

4. **Loot Recap**
   1. Silver brush, comb, and hand mirror set in the suite: **25 gp total** (market value outside Barovia; inside Barovia, likely half).

5. **Campaign Triggers**
   1. If the party shows **compassion** toward the nursery or the memory of the children, you may later allow the nursemaid’s spirit to **assist them** (e.g., brief warnings, advantage on a single saving throw versus a house hazard, or revealing a hidden passage).
   2. If the party **desecrates** the room or mocks the dead, the house may respond more cruelly later (e.g., increased DCs on fear effects, more aggressive haunts).
   3. If any **Tarokka card** related to tragedy, children, or lost innocence was drawn earlier in your campaign (for example, cards themed around **The Innocent, The Broken One, The Marionette**, etc.), you can emphasize that connection here:

      > As you stand in the nursery, a memory from the fortune-teller’s reading stirs unbidden. That card – the one that spoke of innocence betrayed – feels suddenly, painfully relevant. This house seems built on just such betrayals.

---

## 12. Closing Prompt for the DM

End this segment with an open invitation to the players:

> The hallway stretches on, dim and watchful, other doors waiting in the gloom. You’ve seen the traces of the household’s private sorrows. Somewhere above or below, the truth of this house waits for you in the dark.
>
> Where do you go next?

From here, you can move on to **other second-floor rooms and then the upper floors**, which will be covered in **Part 2**.
