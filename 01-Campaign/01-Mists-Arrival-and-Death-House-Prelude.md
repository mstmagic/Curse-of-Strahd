# 1. Mists Arrival and Death House Prelude (Levels 1–2)

> This file is designed to be read verbatim or near‑verbatim by a brand‑new, nervous Dungeon Master. Stage directions are in **bold** and `[square brackets]`. Spoken text for NPCs and narration is in quotation marks. Pause cues and silence prompts are explicitly marked.

## 1.1 Overview for the DM

- This chapter covers the moment the characters enter the Mists and are drawn into Barovia, then find the road to the Village of Barovia and the Death House hook.
- It assumes 3–5 level 1 characters.
- You can run this chapter *before* the existing file `01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House.md`, or treat it as an expanded, slower version of the very beginning.

**Tone & Lore Notes (DM‑only)**
- Barovia is oppressive, colorless, and watched by an unseen predator: Strahd von Zarovich.
- The Mists are an extension of Strahd’s will and of the Dark Powers; they toy with travelers like a cat with mice.
- Strahd is curious about the characters. Early on, he is amused rather than threatened.

## 2. Opening: The Mists Close In

### 2.1 Read‑Aloud: The First Wisps

**[Take a deep breath. Look at your players. When they seem ready, speak slowly and clearly.]**

"The air grows colder.

A thin, white fog snakes across the ground, curling around your boots and the wheels of your cart. It spreads in thin ribbons, then gathers in thicker banks, until the road you’ve been following fades to a gray smear behind you.

The colors of the world begin to drain away. Greens fade to sickly yellows, then to shades of gray. The sky above is a dull, dirty pewter, as if the sun is hiding behind a shroud of filthy wool. The wind grows still.

All you can hear is your own breathing… and the soft rustle of the mist as it thickens around you." 

**[Pause. Look around the table. Let 5–10 seconds of silence pass. This is a SILENCE PROMPT. Allow players to react.]**

### 2.2 Prompt: First Reactions

**DM Prompt (open‑ended):**

"What do you do as the fog closes in around you?"

**Likely Player Responses & DM Replies**

- **Player:** "I try to go back the way we came."  
  **DM:** "You turn around and walk… but the road behind you is gone. There is only mist. After a minute of walking, you see a dark line ahead: the same road you just left. Somehow, you’ve walked in a circle. The fog is thicker now, clawing at your legs like cold fingers."  
  **Mechanics:** No check needed; the Mists twist space. If a player insists on tracking: allow a DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check; on success, they *still* end up back where they started, but you describe confusing signs—double footprints, bent branches pointing both ways.

- **Player:** "I call out / shout / ask if anyone’s there."  
  **DM (softly, almost whispering):** "Your voice is swallowed by the fog. The sound comes back to you, dull and distant, like someone else far away is calling your words back at you. No one answers." 

- **Player:** "I draw my weapon and get ready."  
  **DM:** "Your hand closes around the familiar grip of your weapon. The metal feels colder than it should, almost sticky with chill. You see nothing moving—but you can’t shake the feeling that *something* sees you."  
  **Optional:** Ask for a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. On success, they notice vague shapes in the mist—branches, rocks—that *almost* look like figures watching them.

- **Player:** "I light a torch / cast a light spell."  
  **DM:** "You kindle light. It flares to life, a warm bubble in the gray. The mist recoils for a heartbeat… then flows back in, turning the edge of your light into a shifting, swirling wall. Beyond it, the world is gone."  
  **Mechanics:** Vision limited to 30–60 feet at best. Make it clear they’re enclosed but not yet under attack.

**Silence Prompt:** After answering the first round of questions, let a full 10–15 seconds of silence hang. Look at your players expectantly. If no one speaks, gently repeat: "In this dead, gray silence… what do you do?"

### 2.3 Strahd’s First Attention (Optional)

> This is an optional early Strahd interaction. Use it if you want him to feel present from the very beginning.

**Voice & Acting Notes for Strahd (even when unseen)**
- Voice: Smooth, controlled, with a faint accent (Eastern European/Romanian‑inspired). Never raise your voice; let the players lean in.
- Pace: Slow and deliberate. Strahd is never rushed.
- Emotion: Amused curiosity, as if examining interesting insects.

**Trigger:** If the players begin to panic, argue about what to do, or try multiple contradictory directions through the Mists.

**Read‑Aloud (disembodied voice):**

"For a moment… the fog stills.

Then, from somewhere ahead, or behind, or above you—

a man’s voice, smooth as polished onyx, glides through the mist.

'How delightful,' it says. 'New guests… lost already.'

The words echo, gentle and mocking at once. 'Do not fear, little wanderers. The mists have chosen a path for you. All you must do… is walk.'"

**DM Notes:**
- Do *not* allow the players to locate the source. If they try, say: "The voice comes from everywhere and nowhere at once; the fog itself seems to speak."  
- If they call out, Strahd may answer once or twice, then fall silent, bored.

**Likely Reactions & Responses**

- **Player:** "Who are you? Show yourself!"  
  **Strahd (chuckling softly):** "All in time. For now, be content that you are… noticed."  
  **Then let silence fall again.**

- **Player:** "We don’t follow your path!"  
  **Strahd (pleased):** "Rebellion. How charming. You will follow, all the same. The land itself obeys me."  
  **After this, no more responses. Let them stew in it.**

- **Player:** "We ignore the voice and keep moving."  
  **DM:** "You press on. The mist thickens, then thins… and, at last, you see shapes ahead: dark trees, a road, and a looming iron gate."  

## 3. The Gates of Barovia

### 3.1 Battlefield & Layout

- **Environment:** Old Svalich Road leading to Barovia. Trees press close on both sides like a black wall. Overhead, thick branches knit together, blotting out the sky.
- **Feature:** A massive pair of stone gateposts, carved into headless, armless giants in ancient, weather‑worn armor. Between them: rusted iron gates hanging slightly open.
- **Map Note:** If using a map, pin this entry as `M1 – The Gates of Barovia`.

There is **no planned combat** here, but wolves or other beasts can appear if you want an early fight (see Encounter 3.3).

### 3.2 Read‑Aloud: Approaching the Gates

"The fog thins just enough to reveal towering shapes looming ahead.

Two colossal stone pillars rise from the mist, each carved in the likeness of a mournful giant in ancient armor. Time and weather have worn away their faces and arms; they stand like decapitated sentinels over the road.

Between them hangs a pair of iron gates. Rust has eaten them in jagged holes, and they sag slightly on their hinges. Despite their decay, they rise nearly thirty feet high.

As you draw near, the gates creak… and slowly swing inward on their own.

A cold breath of fog rolls out to meet you, as if the land itself were exhaling." 

**Silence Prompt:** Do not speak for 5–8 seconds. Let the image sit.

### 3.3 Player Prompts & Likely Actions

**Prompt:** "The gates stand open before you, and the forest crowds close on either side. What do you do?"

- **Player:** "I check for traps / examine the gates."  
  **DM:** "Roll an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check."  
  - DC 12: They find no mechanical traps, just old rust and faint claw marks.  
  - On success, describe: "You see long, parallel grooves in the stone near the base of the gates. They look like the marks of claws… far larger than any wolf’s."  
  - On failure: "You see only age and decay; if there were traps here once, time has already sprung them."

- **Player:** "I listen carefully."  
  **DM:** "Roll a Wisdom (Perception) check, DC 12."  
  - Success: "Beyond the gates, somewhere in the forest, you hear a distant wolf’s howl… then another answering it, farther away. The sound seems to circle you."  
  - Failure: "You hear only the windless silence and the faint creak of the open gates." 

- **Player:** "I don’t go through; I go around into the forest."  
  **DM (firm but calm):** "You step off the road into the trees. After a minute of pushing through cold underbrush, you realize that no matter which way you turn, the stone pillars loom ahead of you. The forest bends your path back to the road, as if the land itself will not let you bypass the gates."  
  **Mechanics:** The Mists and the Dark Powers funnel them; no check can bypass this.

- **Player:** "I go through the gates."  
  **DM:** "You step between the towering pillars. The iron gates groan behind you… and then, with a sudden crash, they swing shut."  

**Sound Cue (if you like theatricality):** Bang the table once as you say "crash" to startle them slightly.

### 3.4 Optional Encounter: Wolves of the Border

> Optional encounter for groups that want early combat or need XP before Death House.

**Trigger:** If the party lingers at the gates for more than 5–10 minutes in‑game, or if they repeatedly try to flee back into the Mists.

**Monsters:**
- 3–5 Wolves (MM p. 341) for a 4‑person level 1 party. Adjust by ±1 wolf for smaller/larger groups or weaker/stronger parties.

**Battlefield Layout:**
- The party is on the road near the gate. Forest on both sides (lightly obscured by mist; treat as lightly obscured terrain).  
- Wolves emerge from the mist at 30–40 feet away in a loose semicircle, attempting to encircle the party.

**Read‑Aloud (when combat begins):**

"A low growl rises from the fog to your left. A second growl answers it from the right.

Gray shapes pad out of the swirling mist—wolves, lean and hungry, eyes gleaming with a feral, unnatural intelligence. Their fur is matted and wet, and as they step closer, their growls blend into something that almost sounds like a chuckle.

More shapes appear behind them, forming a loose ring around you on the road." 

**DM Tactics Notes:**
- Wolves use Pack Tactics to focus on isolated or weak targets.  
- They test the party, not necessarily fight to the death. When reduced to half their number, the survivors withdraw, fading back into the fog.

**Strahd Interaction (Optional):**
- If you want Strahd present: during the fight, one wolf briefly has glowing red eyes. On a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check, a character realizes something is *riding inside* the beast’s mind, observing through it. That is Strahd’s distant attention.

**Loot:**
- No meaningful loot; these are wild creatures.  
- If a player insists on searching: "You find burrs, old blood, and bits of bone. Whatever these wolves eat, it is not well‑cleaned."  

## 4. The Road to the Village and the Death House Hook

### 4.1 Travel Atmosphere

"Beyond the gates, the Old Svalich Road winds into a valley shrouded in mist.

Black, twisted trees line the road like skeletal fingers clawing at the sky. Their branches are heavy with dead, brittle leaves that rattle softly, though there is no wind.

Every now and then, the fog parts just enough for you to glimpse dark hills rising in the distance, crowned with dense forests. High above them, barely visible through the gray sky, stands the vague outline of a distant castle perched on craggy cliffs.

The castle’s tallest spire pierces the clouds like a black needle. For just a heartbeat, you could swear you see a tiny glow of red light at one of its windows… and then the mist swallows it again." 

**Silence Prompt:** Let the players react. Give them space to ask, "Is that where we’re going?" Reply vaguely: "You don’t know yet. But the castle watches the valley like a vulture circling its prey."

### 4.2 Optional Strahd Interaction: The Passing Carriage

> Use this if you want an early, dramatic glimpse of Strahd, without combat.

**Trigger:** After an hour of in‑game travel along the road, or whenever conversation lulls.

**Read‑Aloud:**

"From far behind you on the road comes the faint, rhythmic clatter of hooves and wheels.

Turning, you see a black carriage emerging from the fog. Its lacquered sides gleam even in the gray light, and its windows are shrouded with dark curtains. Two coal‑black horses pull it, their breath steaming in the cold air.

The carriage rolls toward you at an unhurried pace, as if the driver knows there is nowhere for you to go." 

**NPC: The Coachman (Strahd’s Servant)**
- **Voice:** Low, formal, very few words. Slight accent, but less refined than Strahd’s.  
- **Mannerisms:** Rigid posture, never looks players fully in the eye. Gloved hands.  
- **Personality:** Perfectly obedient, not chatty. Gives only rehearsed lines.

**When the carriage draws near:**

"The carriage slows and comes to a stop a few paces from you. The driver, a gaunt man in a dark, formal coat and high collar, tips his hat.

In a voice just above a whisper, he says:

'My master bids you welcome to Barovia. The road ahead is long and cruel. If you wish for… comfort… the castle’s doors will open to you—when he desires it.'"

**Likely Questions & Responses**

- **Player:** "Who is your master?"  
  **Coachman:** "He is the lord of this land. You will know his name soon enough."  

- **Player:** "Can we ride in the carriage?"  
  **Coachman (if you want early castle visit – high danger, optional):** "If my master invites you, yes. Today, he watches only."  
  **And the carriage drives on.**  
  **OR (if you *do* want to take them to the castle for a brief audience):** Mark this as a **Campaign Trigger**: `If the DM desires an early castle audience, the carriage door opens by itself. Inside, plush seats and darkness. If the players enter, they are borne to Castle Ravenloft for a short, controlled scene with Strahd` (to be detailed in a separate file).

- **Player:** "Is it safe here?"  
  **Coachman (smiles thinly):** "Safe? No. But you are… expected. My master prefers his guests alive. At first."  

After a few answers, the coachman tips his hat and drives on, vanishing into the mist ahead or behind (your choice).

### 4.3 Arrival at the Village Outskirts and the Death House Kids

This section leads directly into the Death House adventure. You may already have a Death House file (`01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House.md`). This prelude slows the approach and provides acting notes.

**Read‑Aloud: Approaching the Village**

"The road descends into a valley where the fog thickens again, hugging the ground like a dirty, wet blanket.

Shapes emerge from the gray: buildings, tightly packed, their upper stories leaning over narrow streets like they are trying to whisper to one another.

Most of the houses are dark and silent, their windows like black, empty eyes. A few show faint candlelight behind drawn curtains.

The smell hits you: damp earth, rotting wood, chimney smoke… and underneath it all, the sour tang of old fear." 

**Silence Prompt:** Let this hang for a moment. Then ask: "As you step into this dead, mist‑choked village… what do you do?"

### 4.4 The Children Outside the Death House

**Location:** A side street a short way into the village. Mark this as `M2 – Death House Street` on your map.

**NPCs:** Rose and Thorn (children, illusions/spirits bound to the house).

**How to Play Rose (older sister):**
- Age: Around 10–11.  
- Voice: Slightly formal, trying to sound braver and older than she is. A bit shaky.  
- Mannerisms: Keeps herself between the players and Thorn. Clutches a small, faded doll (optional).  
- Emotion: Fear, determination, a hint of unnatural composure (she’s not fully alive in the normal sense).

**How to Play Thorn (younger brother):**
- Age: Around 5–6.  
- Voice: Soft, high‑pitched, sniffly.  
- Mannerisms: Hides behind Rose, peeks out, wipes nose on sleeve.  
- Emotion: Scared, on the edge of tears.

**Read‑Aloud (Spotting the Children):**

"As you follow the creaking street deeper into the village, the wind carries a thin, desperate sound to your ears: the sound of a child crying.

Through the drifting fog, you see two small figures standing in the middle of the road.

An older girl in a tattered, once‑nice dress holds the hand of a little boy clutching a stuffed toy. They stand before a tall, dark townhouse whose upper windows gape like empty sockets.

The girl raises a hand as you approach. 'Stop!' she calls out, her voice trembling. 'You… you shouldn’t go any closer! There’s a monster inside!'" 

**Silence Prompt:** Let the players react to "monster." Do not rush.

### 4.5 Dialog with Rose and Thorn

**Rose’s Opening Lines (speak as written, gently acting them):**

"Please," the girl says, clutching her brother’s hand tighter. "Our parents went inside to deal with the monster in the basement. They told us to stay out here… but it’s been so long. We’re scared." 

Thorn mumbles, barely audible: "I’m cold, Rosie…"  
Rose squeezes his hand. "Please. You… you look strong. Can you help us? Can you make the monster go away?"

**Likely Questions & Responses**

- **Player:** "What monster? What does it look like?"  
  **Rose:** "We… we haven’t seen it. We just hear terrible howls and grinding noises from the basement. Sometimes the whole house shakes. The servants used to whisper about it. They said our parents were feeding it."  
  **Thorn (whispers):** "I heard it breathing once. Right under the floor, near my bed…"  

- **Player:** "Where are your parents?"  
  **Rose:** "Inside. Father is Gustav, Mother is Elisabeth. They said they’d handle it and come back. They… they haven’t."  

- **Player:** "Why don’t you go to someone else in the village?"  
  **Rose (glancing at the dark houses):** "They don’t help us. They pretend they can’t hear when we scream. No one comes anymore when the house cries."  

- **Player:** "How long have they been gone?"  
  **Rose (looks confused, as if time is fuzzy):** "I… I don’t know. It feels like forever. Please, just… help us."

**Acting Note:** When the players try to pin Rose down on specific time or details that would reveal the children are ghosts/illusions, have her become confused, frowning, then redirect: "Does it matter? The monster is still there."

### 4.6 Entering or Refusing the Death House

**Prompt:** "The children look up at you with wide, desperate eyes. The dark doorway of the house yawns behind them like a waiting mouth. What do you do?"

**If Players Agree to Help and Enter the House:**

- Rose steps aside, still holding Thorn’s hand.  
- **Rose:** "Thank you. The front door is open. The bedrooms are upstairs. The basement stairs are… hidden. The servants used to go down, but we weren’t allowed."  
- Lead directly into your detailed Death House file (`01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House.md`) for room‑by‑room play.

**If Players Refuse or Want to Walk Away:**

- **Rose (voice breaking):** "You… you’re leaving? Please! We have no one else. The monster will come for us next. Don’t go!"  
- Thorn starts crying openly.

If they *still* walk away:
- The Mists thicken at the end of the street, making it feel like the only path forward is back past the house.  
- **Optional Strahd Interaction:** As they try to leave, a distant laugh echoes through the fog (Strahd amused by their cowardice).  
- You may introduce an **Optional Side Hook**: an NPC in the village mentions that adventurers who spurn the pleas of children rarely find good fortune in Barovia.

**Campaign Trigger – Strahd’s Interest in Cowardice:**
- If the party refuses to help the children, note: `Strahd marks them as cowards. He will later taunt them about "abandoning babes to the dark." This may affect his dialog and how he toys with them.`

### 4.7 Transition to Existing Death House File

Once the party agrees to enter the Death House, end this file with a clear instruction to switch.

**DM Closing Narration for This File:**

"You stand before the tall, dark house, its gray stone walls slick with moisture, its windows like watching eyes.

The front door stands closed but not locked.

Behind you, the fog curls at the edges of the street, pressing in like a silent crowd. Ahead, the house waits.

From somewhere deep inside, you think you hear… a faint, distant chanting. Or maybe it’s just the wind.

The children watch you with anxious, unblinking eyes.

What do you do?" 

**[When the players say they enter, transition:]**

"You step up to the door of the house… and cross the threshold into its waiting darkness."

> **DM:** At this point, switch to `01-Into-the-Mists-and-Death-House.md` for the detailed, room‑by‑room Death House sequence. Use the same tone of oppressive dread, and remember that Strahd is watching, even when he does not appear.
