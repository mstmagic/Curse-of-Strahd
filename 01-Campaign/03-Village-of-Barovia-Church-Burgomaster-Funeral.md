# 1. Overview: Village of Barovia – Church, Burgomaster’s Mansion, and Kolyan’s Funeral

This file is a step‑by‑step script for a brand‑new Dungeon Master with weak acting skills. You can read this text almost word for word at the table. It covers the rest of **Day 1** and **Day 2** in the Village of Barovia after the events of `02-Village-of-Barovia-and-First-Night.md`.

It assumes:
- The characters are **level 2** (or just reaching level 3 after Death House, depending on how you’re pacing XP).
- They have already arrived in the **Village of Barovia**, spent some time exploring, and taken a long rest (their **First Night**).
- Ireena is either about to meet them, has just met them, or will meet them soon at the Burgomaster’s mansion (this file supports all three options).

Lore is taken from **Curse of Strahd, Chapter 3: The Village of Barovia**, plus **Appendix B: Death House**, but the narration is expanded and heavily scripted.

1. **Morning After the First Night** – Waking up, village ambience, rumors.
2. **Approach to the Church of Barovia** – Road, atmosphere, background NPCs.

# 3. General DM Guidance for This File

## 3.1 How to Use the Scripted Dialogue

- Text in **quotation marks** is meant to be read out loud to the players.
- Text in *italics* is guidance for you, the DM.
- Use the **Player Response Prompts** if players are quiet or unsure.
- Use the **Silence Prompts** to consciously stop talking and let them speak.

## 3.2 Tone of Barovia in This Phase

Barovia is:
- Tired
- Afraid
- Resigned
- Occasionally bitterly sarcastic

There is almost no overt joy, only flickers of warmth around people like **Ireena** and the memory of **Kolyan**.

Keep your narration:
- **Slow and deliberate**
- **Quiet but clear**
- **Descriptive, focusing on smell, cold, and silence**

---

# 4. Scene 1 – Morning After the First Night

This scene assumes the characters sleep somewhere safe in the Village of Barovia (an inn, a villager’s home, the Burgomaster’s mansion, or even a sheltered ruin). If your previous session ended somewhere specific, adjust the opening lines to fit that location.

## 4.1 Opening Narration

Read this slowly, with a tired, low tone:

> **Narration**
> "Morning comes, but the sky never brightens. A gray light seeps through the thin clouds like dirty water through cloth. The air is cold and damp, and the smell of wet rot clings to everything — old wood, moldy straw, damp stone.
> 
> Somewhere in the village, a dog barks once and then goes quiet. A church bell tolls… once… twice… a third time… the sound dull and heavy, swallowed by the mist.
> 
> Your bodies ache from yesterday’s journey. Muscles are stiff, and every breath you take reminds you that this place is not your home. You hear distant, muffled voices outside: tired people beginning another hopeless day."

**Silence Prompt:**
- *Pause for 5–10 seconds. Look at the players. Let them speak first.*

If they say nothing, use gentle prompts.

## 4.2 Player Interaction Prompts

Ask:
- **Closed**: "Who is the first to wake up?" (Point to a player if needed.)
- **Open**: "What does your character do in the first few minutes of this grim Barovian morning?"  
  *Let each player answer. Acknowledge with a brief nod or short in-character reaction from an NPC if present.*

If they check supplies, weapons, or wounds:

> **DM**: "Your gear is cold to the touch, like it has been lying in a crypt. Metal has a faint film of moisture from the ever‑present fog. Nothing is missing… yet."

If they look out a window or door:

> **Narration**
> "Outside, villagers move like ghosts: shoulders hunched, heads down, wrapped in threadbare coats. A woman with a basket of limp, gray vegetables trudges by. A young boy clings to her skirt, staring up at the sky as if hoping to see a sun that never comes."

**Likely Player Responses & DM Reactions**

1. **Player**: "Is there any place to get food or breakfast?"
   - **DM**:  
     > "You remember the faint smell of baking bread from the village’s main street the day before. Here, food is scarce, but not gone. You can search for a tavern or bakery, or ask the locals — if they’ll talk to you. What do you do?"

2. **Player**: "I want to check on [important NPC from previous session]."
   - **DM**:  
     > "You find them as you left them, though the night has not been kind. Their eyes are ringed with shadow, and their movements are slow. When they see you, there’s a flicker of something like relief — or maybe just curiosity that you survived the night."

3. **Player**: "Can we leave the village? This place is awful."
   - **DM (calm, slightly ominous)**:  
     > "You can try to leave, yes. The road that brought you here still runs through the village and out into the mists. But you remember the way the fog closed behind you… and how it seemed to watch.
     > 
     > For now, one place in the village calls to you more strongly than the rest: the **church**, whose bell you just heard."

If they seem directionless, gently steer:

> **DM**: "As you gather yourselves, the church bell tolls again. It’s close — somewhere up the hill at the edge of the village. The sound is weary, like a voice that has been shouting prayers into the dark for years. What do you do?"

---

# 5. Scene 2 – Approach to the Church of Barovia

## 5.1 Street and Atmosphere

As they head toward the church, describe the journey. Walk them up the muddy, rutted road.

> **Narration**
> "You follow the muddy street toward higher ground. The houses here look even worse than before: sagging roofs, shattered windows, doors hanging crooked on rusted hinges. A sour, smoky smell hangs in the air — woodsmoke from thin fires, mixed with the stink of unwashed bodies and damp animal fur.
> 
> You pass a narrow alley where a stray dog noses through a pile of garbage, ribs showing beneath patchy fur. It freezes when it sees you, eyes wide, tail between its legs, then darts away into the mist.
> 
> As you climb, the sound of the bell grows louder. The chime is off‑key, as if the bell is cracked. Crows circle above the rooftops, their black feathers stark against the colorless sky."

**Silence Prompt:**
- *Pause briefly after the dog scene to let players react or investigate.*

If a player wants to help the dog:

> **DM**: "You hold out a hand, but the animal flinches and disappears into the fog‑choked alley. Here, even the stray animals have learned to fear strangers."  
> *(This reinforces the fear of the land without punishing the player.)*

## 5.2 Background NPCs

Add one or two quick moments to make the world feel alive.

- An old man with a cart of firewood.
- A young woman hanging laundry that never seems to dry.
- A hunched figure quickly shutting a door when the party gets too close.

You can improvise, or use this:

> **Narration**
> "An old man pushes a small handcart loaded with chopped wood. His beard is yellowed and thin; his eyes dart from you to the shadows and back again.
> 
> As you approach, he mutters something under his breath in a language you don’t recognize. He doesn’t stop, and he doesn’t meet your gaze for long. People here have learned that looking too closely at new things can be dangerous."

If players address him:

- **Voice & Acting for Old Man**:  
  - Voice: Reedy, tired, slightly wheezing.  
  - Pace: Short, clipped sentences.  
  - Body: Hunched shoulders, hands always busy with the cart.

> **Old Man (if spoken to)**
> "Eh? Travelers? Hah… too late to turn back now. The mists have you. They don’t let go."
>
> *He glances up the hill toward the church.*
>
> "If you’re smart, you’ll find a priest… or a grave. Either way, sooner or later, you’ll need one."

**Player Response Options & DM Reactions**

1. **Polite inquiry** – "What’s wrong with this place?"
   - **Old Man**:  
     > "Everything. The land, the sky, the count in his cursed castle. But you didn’t come here to hear an old man complain. Go on. The dead don’t wait, and neither does he."  
     *On "he", lower your voice and glance toward Castle Ravenloft.*

2. **Threatening** – "Tell us what you know or we’ll make you talk."
   - **Old Man (fearful, defiant)**:  
     > "You think you can scare me? I’ve outlived wolves, witches, and worse. Do what you want. The count will do worse."  
     *He hurries away, refusing to speak more.*

3. **Kind** – "Do you need help with your cart?"
   - **Old Man (softened)**:  
     > "No one offers help in Barovia. Either you’re fools, or you’re not from here. Keep your strength. You’ll need it."  
     *He nods once in genuine respect and moves on.*

## 5.3 First Sight of the Church

As the party reaches the top of the rise:

> **Narration**
> "At the far end of the muddy street stands a weary church. Its once‑white walls are stained gray by smoke and time. The steeple leans slightly, as if tired of holding itself upright. A faded symbol of the Morninglord — a simple sunburst — hangs crooked above the double doors.
> 
> The smell of cold stone and old incense drifts on the air, mixed with a faint, sour scent of something rotten beneath it. Several gravestones lean at odd angles in the small graveyard beside the church, their names half‑erased by weather and neglect.
> 
> As you watch, the front doors shudder with a heavy thud from within, as if someone… or something… struck them from the inside."

**Silence Prompt:**
- *Say nothing for a full 5 seconds. Let them react.*

If they ask what that was:

> **DM**: "The sound echoes once and then fades. No voice follows. The only reply is the distant caw of a crow."  
> *Then ask:* "What do you do?"

---

# 6. Scene 3 – Inside the Church: Donavich and Doru

This scene can be played entirely as roleplay, or can erupt into a dangerous combat with **Doru**.

## 6.1 Entering the Church

If they open the doors:

> **Narration**
> "The heavy doors groan as you push them open, their hinges shrieking in protest. Inside, the church is dim, lit only by a few weak candles guttering in iron sconces.
> 
> The smell of old incense, dust, and cold stone wraps around you. Wooden pews stand in crooked rows, scarred and splintered. Claw marks mar the floor near the entrance, and dried blood stains the boards in long, dragged streaks.
> 
> At the far end of the nave, beneath a cracked sunburst window, an altar stands draped in a once‑fine cloth now moth‑eaten and stained. Behind it, a gaunt priest in tattered vestments mutters a broken prayer.
> 
> From somewhere below the floor, you hear a voice — not a shout, but a desperate, hoarse cry — "Faaather… I’m so… hungry…""

**Silence Prompt:**
- *Let the players sit with the disembodied voice. Do not explain immediately.*

## 6.2 NPC: Father Donavich

### How to Voice and Play Donavich

- **Voice**: Shaky, exhausted, occasionally breaking. Think of someone who has not truly slept in days.
- **Tone**: Desperate faith clinging on by a thread. He truly believes in the Morninglord, but he is breaking.
- **Body Language**: Hunched shoulders, wringing hands, flinching when Doru cries out.
- **Pace**: Speak slowly, often pausing mid‑sentence to search for words or steady his breathing.

### Donavich’s First Interaction

When he notices the characters:

> **Donavich**  
> *Startle slightly, then force a weak, hopeful smile.*  
> "Ah… visitors. The Morninglord has not abandoned us after all. Forgive me, I… I did not hear you come in. These old ears…"  
> 
> *Another cry echoes from below: "Faaather…" Donavich winces, eyes squeezing shut for a moment.*  
> 
> "Please, don’t be alarmed. You are safe here. This is a house of… of prayer."  
> *His voice cracks on the last word.*

**Likely Player Questions & Donavich’s Answers**

1. **"Who is that voice?"**
   - **Donavich (pained)**:  
     > "My son. My boy, Doru. He… he was lost. Taken in by false hope, by a mad wizard who promised salvation. Instead, he found the devil’s wrath. He returned… different. Cursed."

2. **"Different how?"**
   - **Donavich**:  
     > "He bears the curse of undeath. He is… a vampire spawn. But he is still my son. I hear his voice, and I cannot… I cannot give up on him."

3. **"Why is he locked below?"**
   - **Donavich**:  
     > "To protect the village. To protect you. When the hunger comes, he… he is not himself. I have prayed, day after day, for the Morninglord’s light to cleanse him. There must be a way. There must."  
     *His eyes are red‑rimmed, his hands trembling.*

4. **"Why not kill him?"**
   - **Donavich (anguished)**:  
     > "Could you drive a stake through the heart of your own child? Could you listen to their cries and answer with a blade? I… I am weak. Or perhaps I am faithful. I don’t know anymore."

## 6.3 Player Interaction Prompts in the Church

If the players are quiet:

- **Open Prompt**: "You stand in the dim church, the priest’s words hanging in the cold air, the muffled cries from below growing weaker but no less desperate. What do you do?"
- **Closed Prompt**: "Do you approach the altar, speak to the priest, or investigate the sound from below?" (Offer 2–3 choices.)

If they investigate the claw marks or blood:

> **DM**: "The claw marks are deep and ragged, carved into the wood by something strong and desperate. The dried blood is smeared in long streaks leading back toward the door, as if someone — or several someones — were dragged or crawled here while wounded."  
> *If they press Donavich:*  
> **Donavich**: "When Doru first returned, he… he tried to escape. Villagers came to help. There was panic. Screams. Some did not make it back to their homes."  
> *His voice dies away.*

## 6.4 The Doru Dilemma

At some point, the players will decide:
- To **leave Doru where he is**.
- To **try to help or cure him**.
- To **destroy him** (fight).

You do **not** need to force a combat. Let their choice stand.

### Saving Throws & Checks

- **Insight (DC 12)** on Donavich:  
  - Success: "He is telling the truth as he understands it. He is desperate, exhausted, but sincere."  
  - Failure: "He seems unstable; it’s hard to tell if he’s hiding something or just crumbling under guilt."

- **Religion (DC 13)** to recall knowledge of vampires and curses:  
  - Success: "You know that vampire spawn are dangerous undead, and that their condition is not easily cured. Powerful holy magic might purge the curse, but simple prayer is unlikely to be enough."  
  - Failure: "You know little beyond tales of blood‑drinking monsters that fear sunlight and holy symbols."

- **Persuasion (DC 14)** to get Donavich to **allow them to confront Doru**:  
  - Success: He reluctantly leads them to the trapdoor.  
  - Failure: He insists they stay away, potentially forcing them to sneak or intimidate him.

- **Intimidation (DC 13)** to compel Donavich:  
  - Success: He breaks down and yields, sobbing.  
  - Failure: He cries out in fear, potentially waking Doru’s rage and triggering combat even if the party didn’t intend it.

## 6.5 Opening the Trapdoor (If They Go Below)

If they choose to approach the trapdoor, Donavich leads them, or they find it on their own in the back of the church.

> **Narration**
> "At the rear of the church, behind the altar, a narrow door leads to a cramped vestry. The air here is thick with the smell of old incense and mildew. In the corner, half‑hidden by a threadbare rug, is a heavy wooden trapdoor reinforced with rusty iron bands.
> 
> As you draw near, the voice from below grows a little stronger. "Faaather… I smell… strangers…""

**Silence Prompt:**
- *Pause 3–5 seconds, letting that line land.*

If they open the trapdoor:

> **Narration**
> "You haul the trapdoor open. It rises with a groan, the iron bands scraping against the frame. A wave of cold, stale air rushes up from the darkness below, carrying the smell of dry earth, old blood, and something… sweet and rotten.
> 
> A narrow stone staircase descends into blackness. You hear the sound of something moving down there: scratching, shuffling, the scrape of claws on stone."

Ask: **"Who goes first down the stairs, and in what order do you follow?"**

### Battlefield Layout – Church Undercroft

- Small, cramped stone room.
- Low ceiling; medium creatures can move normally, but no large leaps or flying.
- 3–4 old coffins stacked or pushed against walls.
- A few broken crates and barrels for half‑cover.
- One entrance: the staircase.

Draw a simple map:
- Roughly **25 ft x 25 ft** square.  
- Staircase in one corner.  
- Coffins along two walls.  
- Doru initially crouched in the far corner or on the ceiling (for a jump scare) if you like.

## 6.6 NPC/Monster: Doru the Vampire Spawn

### How to Voice and Play Doru

- **Voice**: Raspy, hollow, like someone whose throat is raw from screaming.
- **Emotion**: A mix of childlike pleading and animal hunger.
- **Body Language**: Twitchy, sudden movements, constantly sniffing the air.

When they first see him:

> **Narration**
> "In the far corner, half‑hidden by shadow, something crouches. Pale, too thin, with long, clawed fingers digging furrows in the stone. Its hair is matted and filthy, its clothes torn and stained.
> 
> It lifts its head, and you see its face: the sunken cheeks of a starving youth, eyes glowing faintly red in the dark, and long, sharp fangs jutting over cracked lips.
> 
> It stares at you, chest heaving, nostrils flaring as it sniffs the air."

> **Doru**  
> "New…"  
> *He swallows hard, shuddering.*  
> "New blood… Please… I’m so hungry…"  
> 
> *He looks up toward the trapdoor.*  
> "Faaather… you brought them… for me?"

### Likely Player Responses

1. **They try to talk and calm him.**
   - **Doru (torn)**:  
     > "You… you should go. I don’t want… I don’t…"  
     > *His claws dig deeper into the stone.*  
     > "But you smell… so… good…"  
   - *Have him make a visible effort to restrain himself. If they show kindness, let him hesitate rather than immediately attack.*

2. **They immediately attack.**
   - **Doru (snarling)**:  
     > "No more prayers… no more waiting…"  
     > *He launches himself forward, hunger overcoming everything else.*

3. **They promise to find a cure.**
   - **Doru (confused hope)**:  
     > "A cure? Can… can the hunger stop? Can I… see the sun again?"  
     > *His eyes flicker with something almost human.*  
     > "Father said the Morninglord would save me. The Morninglord never answered."  
   - *You can allow them to leave him alive, creating a long‑term moral thread. He may still break and attack if they linger too long in close reach.*

## 6.7 Combat Encounter – Doru

Use the **Vampire Spawn** stat block from the Monster Manual / Appendix D, but you are encouraged to **tone Doru down** slightly for a very low‑level party:

- Consider reducing his hit points by **one third**.
- Have him focus attacks on one front‑line character rather than efficiently spreading damage.
- Allow creative options (turning, grapples, sunlight spells, holy water) to have strong effects.

### Initiative and Opening Round

If combat starts:

> **DM**: "Doru’s body coils like a starving wolf’s. His claws scrape against the stone as he lunges toward you with inhuman speed. Everyone, roll initiative."

**Battlefield Reminder**:
- Narrow staircase is a natural choke point.
- Characters higher on the stairs can hold the line.
- Coffins and crates provide cover if players want to hide or reposition.

### Doru’s Tactics

- Doru is **hungry, not clever**. He:
  - Focuses on the closest, easiest target.
  - May break off if **turned** by divine magic or badly injured.
  - Hisses and cries for his father throughout the fight.

> **Doru (during combat)**
> "It hurts! It always hurts! Make it stop!"
>
> "Faaather! Why won’t you help me?!"

### Player Checks & Saving Throws

- **Wisdom saving throw (DC 12)** if a character is particularly compassionate and sees Doru cry or beg:  
  - Success: They steel their heart, able to continue without penalty.  
  - Failure: They hesitate for a moment (flavor only), or suffer **disadvantage on their next attack** against Doru because of guilt. Use sparingly.

- **Donavich’s Reaction**: If he hears combat:  
  - He may rush to the trapdoor, crying:  
    > "No! Please! Don’t harm him! He’s still my son!"  
  - You decide if he tries to physically intervene; if so, treat him as a **non‑combatant** who can be pushed back with a gentle shove.

### Ending the Encounter

If Doru is reduced to 0 hit points:

> **Narration**
> "Doru staggers, red eyes dimming. He reaches out with one clawed hand as if trying to grasp something just beyond his reach.
> 
> "I’m… so… tired…" he whispers.
> 
> His body crumples, the unnatural tension leaving his limbs. For a moment, he looks almost human — just a boy who has finally escaped a nightmare. Then his body begins to crumble into gray ash, scattering across the cold stone floor."

If Doru survives and the party retreats:

> **Narration**
> "You pull back up the stairs, slamming the trapdoor as Doru’s enraged howls echo in the cramped undercroft. The wood shudders under a final, furious blow… then falls silent except for ragged, hungry breathing below."

**Aftermath with Donavich**:

- If Doru died: Donavich collapses in grief.  
- If Doru lives: Donavich clings to hope, perhaps even resenting the party.

> **Donavich (if Doru died)**
> *He falls to his knees, hands clutching at his holy symbol.*  
> "It is… done. My boy is gone. May the Morninglord judge you with more mercy than I have known."  
> *He looks at you with hollow eyes.*  
> "I will… I will bury what remains. Perhaps… perhaps now, the church will be truly holy again."

> **Donavich (if Doru lives)**
> "You see? He still fights it. There is hope. There must be. I will pray harder. I will not give up on him. Not yet."  
> *He looks at you with desperate gratitude or suspicion, depending on how you treated Doru.*

# 7. Optional Strahd Interaction A – The Listening Lord

This is **optional**. Use it if you want Strahd’s presence felt early.

**Trigger Suggestions:**
- The party has just **killed Doru**.
- Or they have **spared him** but clearly struggled morally.
- Or they have **shown remarkable courage or cruelty** in the church.

## 7.1 Setup

As the party leaves the church or steps outside into the graveyard, read:

> **Narration**
> "The church doors close behind you with a heavy thud. The air outside feels no warmer, but at least it is open. The small graveyard stretches away on one side: crooked headstones, patches of thin, dead grass, and earth that looks like it has been disturbed too many times.
> 
> A cold wind stirs the mist, making it curl around the gravestones like pale fingers. For a moment, you feel as if something is watching you — not from the houses, not from the graves… but from above."

**Silence Prompt:**
- *Pause. Slowly turn your own gaze upward, as if seeing something far away.*

## 7.2 Strahd’s Presence (No Direct Dialogue Yet)

You may choose to have **no visible Strahd**, just his influence:

> **Narration**
> "Far beyond the village, high on the crag where Castle Ravenloft clings to the stone like a great black claw, you see a tiny shape on a balcony. It is too distant to make out clearly, but you feel — you know — that someone stands there, looking down at you.
> 
> The wind seems to whisper through the bare branches: a soft, amused chuckle carried across the valley."

If you want him to speak in their minds (telepathic / supernatural presence):

- **How to Voice Strahd (Distant Presence)**:  
  - Smooth, confident, amused.  
  - Deep but not booming; use a slightly theatrical accent if you like.  
  - Speak quietly; let players lean in.

> **Strahd’s Voice (optional)**  
> "Ah. New pieces on my board. How very interesting."  
> 
> "Show me, little heroes… will you be merciful? Or will you be… entertaining?"

Do **not** answer questions aloud if players call out to the sky. Strahd is just tasting their resolve.

**Campaign Trigger – Tarokka Tie‑In (for later)**:
- *Later, after the Tarokka reading, you can say:*  
  > "When you first left the church, and felt that presence on the balcony… that was the moment Strahd decided you were worth a closer look. The card of [relevant Tarokka card] had already turned in your favor — or against it."

# 8. Scene 4 – The Burgomaster’s Mansion Exterior

Once the players are done with the church, gently steer them toward the Burgomaster’s mansion if they aren’t already headed there.

## 8.1 Guiding the Players

If they ask, "What else is in the village?":

> **DM**: "The village is small. You’ve seen the church on the hill, a handful of worn‑down homes, and, near the center, a larger house that looks sturdier than the rest. Locals whispered about the **Burgomaster** before falling quiet. If anyone has answers, it might be there."  
> "Do you want to head toward the large house, explore more of the streets, or do something else?"

If they choose exploration, allow a few minutes of wandering and small NPC moments, then subtly re‑introduce the mansion:

> **Narration**
> "Every road you follow seems to bend back toward the same place: a large, two‑story house with a sagging roof but unbroken windows, its front steps swept clean while every other doorway in the village rots. You get the sense that this building has stood against the darkness longer than most."  
> "Whether by chance or by design, your path keeps leading you here."

## 8.2 Description of the Mansion

> **Narration**
> "The Burgomaster’s mansion stands behind a low stone wall, its iron gate hanging slightly ajar. The yard is choked with weeds, but someone has tried to keep a narrow path clear from the gate to the front door.
> 
> The house itself is weary but proud. Its walls are scarred by age and storm, yet its windows are unbroken, their shutters latched. Thick, heavy curtains block any view inside.
> 
> A faint smell of woodsmoke and old wax drifts from within, mixed with something sharper — maybe the lingering trace of medicines or herbs."

Ask: **"Do you approach the gate? Do you knock, call out, or try something else?"**

If they knock:

> **Narration**
> "Your knock echoes through the quiet village. For a long moment, nothing happens. Then you hear movement inside — a chair scraping, footsteps crossing wood.
> 
> A woman’s voice, firm but edged with caution, calls out through the door: "Who’s there?""

This is likely **Ireena Kolyana**.

# 9. Scene 5 – Inside the Mansion: Ireena and Kolyan’s Body

## 9.1 NPC: Ireena Kolyana

### How to Voice and Play Ireena

- **Voice**: Clear, strong, with a Barovian accent if you can manage one. She is no victim; she is a stubborn survivor.
- **Tone**: Wary but brave. She has seen horrors but refuses to break.
- **Body Language**: Straight back, steady eye contact, hand often resting on a weapon.

### First Contact Through the Door

> **Ireena (through the door)**  
> "This house is under the protection of the Burgomaster. State your names and your business."  
> *Keep her tone calm but alert.*

**Likely Player Responses & Ireena’s Reactions**

1. **Honest and courteous** – "We’re travelers trapped by the mists. We need shelter and information."
   - **Ireena**:  
     > "Travelers… trapped like the rest of us, then. Very well. If you meant harm, you would not bother talking.
     > 
     > Step back from the door and keep your weapons sheathed. I will open it."  
   - She opens, appraises them cautiously.

2. **Aggressive / demanding** – "Open the door or we’ll break it down."
   - **Ireena (cold)**:  
     > "If you try, you will find we are not as helpless as we look. This house has withstood wolves, witches, and worse than you. If you are enemies, turn away. If you are allies… act like it."  
   - If they soften, she may still allow them in, but remains guarded.

3. **Mysterious / evasive** – "We’re here to help… with your problem."
   - **Ireena (suspicious)**:  
     > "That is a strange way to introduce yourselves. Barovia has many problems. Which one is now your business?"  
   - She pushes for clarity before opening.

Once she chooses to let them in:

> **Narration**
> "The door opens to reveal a young woman in battered but well‑kept armor. Her hair is a deep auburn, cut to a practical length, and a longsword hangs at her hip. Her eyes are wary but intelligent, scanning each of you in turn.
> 
> Behind her, the interior of the mansion is dim but orderly. Candles burn low in wall sconces, casting long shadows over the worn furniture. The smell of wax and old paper mixes with a faint, sharp odor — like herbs used in medicine or funerary rites."

> **Ireena**  
> "I am Ireena Kolyana, daughter of the late Burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich. If you have come to rob the dead, turn around now. If you have come to help… then enter, and close the door behind you."  
> *She steps aside, watching them carefully.*

## 9.2 Kolyan’s Body

At some point early in the mansion scene, reveal Kolyan’s corpse.

> **Narration**
> "In the main room, a large table has been cleared and draped with a clean cloth. Resting upon it is the body of an older man, his face lined with age and care but strangely peaceful now.
> 
> His hands are folded over his chest, and around his neck hangs a simple holy symbol of the Morninglord. Candles burn at his head and feet, their light flickering across the pale skin of his face. You notice faint bruising at his throat, as if from powerful hands… or something worse."

If players ask what happened:

> **Ireena (controlled grief)**  
> "He died of a broken heart and a shattered body. For weeks, wolves — and worse — hurled themselves at our home, night after night. He held them off with the guards and what strength he had left.
> 
> But the real weight was what he carried for me. The visits. The… attention. No man can fight a devil forever."  
> 
> *She looks toward a shuttered window, jaw tightening.*

## 9.3 Ireena’s Story and Exposition

Use this to explain Barovia and Strahd from her viewpoint.

> **Ireena**  
> "You are not from here. I can hear it in your voices. This land is called Barovia, named for the valley itself — and cursed with the rule of **Count Strahd von Zarovich**.
> 
> He is not just a noble. He is not just a tyrant. He is… something older. Something that the land itself obeys. The mists keep us in, and keep others out. When Strahd wishes to toy with us, the fog opens. When he is bored, it closes."

If they ask about her specifically:

> **Ireena**  
> "For reasons I do not understand, the count has turned his gaze on me. He has visited this house more than once, uninvited, slipping through walls and windows like smoke. He has… tasted my blood."  
> 
> *She touches her neck unconsciously.*  
> "I remember his eyes most of all. They were not filled with hunger alone. There was… longing. And anger. As if he looked at me and saw someone else."

This echoes the lore that Strahd believes Ireena to be a reincarnation of **Tatyana**.

## 9.4 Player Questions & Answers

- **"Why doesn’t anyone leave?"**  
  - **Ireena**: "Many have tried. The mists choke those who wander too far. Sometimes they return as corpses. Sometimes they don’t return at all. This valley is a cage, and Strahd holds the key."

- **"Can Strahd be killed?"**  
  - **Ireena**: "Many believe no. But if that were true, why would he watch us so closely? Why would he toy with heroes, invite them to his castle, test their strength? A man who believes himself untouchable does not bother playing games."

- **"What do you want from us?"**  
  - **Ireena**: "Help me bury my father properly at the church… and then help me escape this village. There is a town to the west, **Vallaki**, said to be better protected. If I can reach it, perhaps I can rest for a time out of his immediate reach."

# 10. Scene 6 – Planning Kolyan’s Funeral

## 10.1 The Request

Ireena formally asks for their help:

> **Ireena**  
> "My father deserves a proper burial. The church of Barovia is still holy ground, even in these times. Father Donavich will perform the rites.
> 
> But I cannot carry my father alone, and the guards we once had are dead or gone. I need strong arms and brave hearts to help me take his body to the church. Will you do this for us?"

**Closed Prompt** (if they hesitate):
- "Do you agree to help with the funeral, or do you refuse?"

Most parties will agree. If they refuse, Ireena will be cold and they may lose her as a companion.

## 10.2 Logistics and Timing

- The funeral can be scheduled for **later the same day** or **the next morning**.
- Use this time to:
  - Let players explore the mansion.
  - Ask questions about Barovia.
  - Prepare spiritually or tactically.

If they search the mansion respectfully, allow small loot:

### Loot – Burgomaster’s Mansion (Non‑intrusive)

- **Healing Herbs & Salves**:  
  - Treat as **2d4+2 healing potions** (flavored as herbal concoctions).  
  - **Price**: Not for sale here; they are part of Ireena’s limited supplies.

- **Old Weapons**:  
  - A **shortsword**, **spear**, or **light crossbow** from the old guard rack.  
  - **Price** (if they later sell them in Vallaki): Use standard PHB prices, but expect only **half value** due to scarcity and fear.

If players loot rudely:

> **Ireena (angry)**  
> "My father is not yet in his grave, and you pick through his home like crows. Is this what passes for honor where you come from?"  
> *She may still work with them out of necessity, but trust is damaged.*

## 10.3 Carrying the Body

> **Narration**
> "When the time comes, Ireena draws back the cloth covering her father’s face and kisses his forehead. She whispers a few words too soft to hear, then nods to you.
> 
> Together, you lift the board on which his body rests. He is not heavy the way living people are; his flesh has already begun to stiffen. The smell of herbs and old sweat rises up, mixing with the candle wax and the faint metallic tang of death."

Ask: **"Who takes which side of the board?"**  
Let this be a moment of quiet respect.

**Silence Prompt:**
- *Give a full 5–10 seconds of silence as they carry the body out of the house.*

---

# 11. Scene 7 – Kolyan’s Funeral at the Church

## 11.1 Procession to the Church

As they move through the village:

> **Narration**
> "The streets of Barovia fall quiet as you pass. Villagers peek from behind shutters and half‑open doors, watching the small procession: the dead Burgomaster, his determined daughter, and the strangers who carry him.
> 
> No one joins you, but a few make the sign of the Morninglord on their chests. Others simply stare with hollow eyes, as if wondering who will be next to leave their home as a corpse."

## 11.2 Setting the Scene in the Church

When they arrive:

> **Narration**
> "The church doors creak open again, and the dim interior greets you like a familiar, sorrowful face. Father Donavich stands by the altar, his shoulders even more slumped than before.
> 
> When he sees the body, he straightens as best he can and crosses himself with the holy symbol of the Morninglord.
> 
> "Bring him here," he says softly. "We will do what we can to honor him.""

They place Kolyan’s body before the altar.

## 11.3 The Funeral Rite – Scripted

You can read this almost exactly as written.

> **Donavich**  
> "Kolyan Indirovich, Burgomaster of this village, stood as a wall between his people and the darkness. His hands were not always gentle, his words not always kind, but his heart beat for Barovia.
> 
> In these lands, death is no stranger. But Kolyan faced it not with despair, but with stubborn courage. He held his home against beasts and horrors, and he carried a burden that would have broken lesser men."  
> 
> *He looks at Ireena.*  
> "For his daughter, he would have faced the devil himself. Perhaps… in his own way, he did."

> **Narration**
> "Donavich sprinkles blessed water over the body, murmuring words in an old tongue. The droplets catch the candlelight like tiny stars before sinking into the cloth."  
> 
> **Donavich**  
> "Morninglord, see this soul. If he must walk these mists again, let it be with purpose, not torment. If he must sleep, let his sleep be dreamless and deep. And if there is any light left in this valley, let it remember the name: Kolyan Indirovich.""

## 11.4 Player Participation

Invite the players to speak:

> **DM (to players)**: "If any of you wish to say a few words over Kolyan’s body — even if you barely knew him — now is the time. A blessing, a story, or even a simple promise will be heard in this house. Who steps forward, if anyone?"

**Silence Prompt:**
- *If no one speaks immediately, wait. Allow awkward silence. Someone may choose to fill it.*

If no one speaks at all, that’s fine; the silence itself is powerful.

## 11.5 Burial in the Graveyard

After the ceremony:

> **Narration**
> "You carry Kolyan’s body out into the graveyard. A fresh grave has been dug beside a row of older stones bearing the same family name.
> 
> The earth is cold and heavy, clumping around your boots. Each shovelful of dirt lands with a dull thud on the board covering his body. The sound echoes in the mist like a slow, steady drumbeat."  
> 
> *Thud. Thud. Thud.*

When it is done:

> **Ireena**  
> *She stands at the foot of the grave, hands clenched.*  
> "Rest now, Father. You have done enough. I will not let your sacrifice be for nothing."  
> 
> *She turns to the party.*  
> "Thank you. Whatever comes next, you have given him peace."

# 12. Optional Strahd Interaction B – The Distant Rider

Use this if you want a more visceral Strahd appearance.

## 12.1 Trigger

- Immediately after Kolyan’s body is lowered into the ground.
- Or as the last shovel of dirt falls.

## 12.2 Appearance

> **Narration**
> "As the final clump of earth falls, a distant sound cuts through the mist: the soft, rhythmic clop of hooves on stone.
> 
> You look up to see, on a hill overlooking the village, a dark horse standing unnaturally still. Astride it sits a tall figure wrapped in a dark cloak. Even from here, you can feel his gaze like cold fingers on your skin.
> 
> The horse’s breath steams in the chill air, though the rider himself seems untouched by the cold."

This is **Strahd** on his nightmare steed.

### How to Voice and Play Strahd (Distant but Direct)

- Do **not** shout. Speak calmly, as if he somehow knows they can hear him.
- Smile slightly as you speak, even if they can’t see you — it will change your tone.

> **Strahd (calling across the distance)**  
> "How touching. Even in this wretched place, there are still those who bury their dead with care."  
> 
> *He inclines his head faintly toward the grave.*  
> "Kolyan Indirovich. A stubborn man. I respect that."  
> 
> *His gaze turns toward Ireena.*  
> "And you, my dear Ireena. You honor him well. But you cannot hide from me forever."  
> 
> *His eyes settle on the party.*  
> "And who are these? New champions? New toys? We shall see."  
> 
> "Welcome to Barovia. Do try not to die too quickly. It is… so much more amusing when hope lingers."  
> 
> *He raises one gloved hand. The horse rears, black mane wild, and then both rider and steed dissolve into swirling mist, carried away on the wind.*

**Player Reactions & DM Responses**

- If they try to **shoot or spell** him:  
  > "Your arrow / spell streaks through the air, but strikes only empty mist where he stood a heartbeat before."  

- If they **shout challenges**:  
  > *If you wish, let his laughter echo faintly, growing softer as the wind carries it away.*  
  > "So eager. Good. I do enjoy enthusiasm."

**Campaign Trigger – Tarokka**:
- Later, after the reading:  
  > "When Strahd appeared on the hill during Kolyan’s funeral, he was already thinking of you in light of the card of [Tarokka card]. That moment was his first real measure of your spirit."

# 13. Scene 8 – Preparing to Leave for Vallaki

With the funeral complete, the natural next step is escorting Ireena to **Vallaki**.

## 13.1 Ireena’s Proposal

> **Ireena**  
> "My father is at rest. This village cannot protect me anymore. Strahd’s eyes are on this house, on these streets. If I stay, more people will die because of me.
> 
> There is a town to the west, Vallaki, said to be safer — for now. High walls, stronger defenses, perhaps even hope. If you will escort me there, I can pay you with what little coin we have and with whatever help I can give along the way.
> 
> Will you take me to Vallaki?"

**Closed Prompt**: "Do you agree to escort Ireena to Vallaki?"  
If they refuse, she may try to go alone, and you can re‑intersect her with them later on the road.

## 13.2 Supplies and Prices

Limited shopping is possible in Barovia Village.

- Basic goods based on PHB list, but:  
  - **Prices are 2x normal** due to scarcity.  
  - Many items are simply **unavailable** (no plate armor, no exotic gear).

Examples:
- **Rations (1 day)**: Usually 5 sp → **1 gp** here.  
- **Torch**: Usually 1 cp → **2 cp** here.  
- **Healer’s kit**: Usually 5 gp → **10 gp**, if available at all.

When they shop, emphasize the desperation:

> **Shopkeeper (weary, suspicious)**  
> "Coin means little if you’re dead. But I’ll take it anyway. Maybe it will comfort me while I wait for the wolves."  
> 
> *He sells only what he absolutely must, counting every coin twice.*

## 13.3 Optional Side Hook – The Lost Child (Retracking Adventure)

If the players start to wander aimlessly or resist going to Vallaki, offer this **optional** hook that ultimately pushes them toward the west road.

> **Narration**
> "As you prepare to leave the churchyard, you hear frantic footsteps and see a woman running toward you, clutching a ragged shawl around her shoulders. Her eyes are wide with panic."

> **Woman (breathless)**  
> "Please! You helped the Burgomaster… you must help me! My son, Tomas, he ran toward the western road — said he heard music in the mists. He’s just a boy. Please, bring him back!"

- This naturally leads the party **westward**, in the same direction as Vallaki.
- Along the way, you can place a small encounter (wolves, scarecrows, or a minor illusion created by one of Strahd’s servants).
- At the end, they find the boy near the road, shaken but alive, reinforcing that leaving the village without help is dangerous.

Reward:
- The mother gives them a **family heirloom** (simple silver locket, worth **15 gp** if sold) and heartfelt thanks.

# 14. Closing the Session

By the end of this file, the party should have:
- Resolved the **Doru** situation one way or another.
- Met and bonded (or clashed) with **Ireena**.
- Given **Kolyan** a proper burial.
- Felt **Strahd’s presence** at least once.
- Agreed (most likely) to escort Ireena toward **Vallaki**.

If you want to end the session on a strong image, use this:

> **Narration**
> "As you leave the graveyard behind, the mists shift along the western road like a curtain waiting to be drawn aside. The sky never brightens, but for a moment, a faint break in the clouds lets a pale ray of light touch Kolyan’s fresh grave.
> 
> Then the clouds close again, and the light is gone. The road to Vallaki lies ahead, swallowed by gray. Somewhere beyond, a castle watches… and waits.
> 
> What do you do?"
