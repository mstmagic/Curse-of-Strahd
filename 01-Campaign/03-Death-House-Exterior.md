# 1. Death House: Exterior & First Approach

*(Full scene-by-scene script and guidance for a brand new, low-confidence DM. Read aloud text is in italics. Stage directions and DM-only guidance are in bold.)*

---

## 1.1 Scene Overview

This file covers everything from the moment the characters first see the Death House to the point where they step inside the front door.

You will run:

1. The approach through the village street
2. First sight of the house
3. Meeting Rose and Thorn (the ghost children) outside
4. Optional early Strahd interaction (distant, atmospheric)
5. Player investigations outside the house
6. Entering the house (but not exploring inside yet)

Use this as a pin for: **“Death House – Exterior & Entrance”** on the map.

Recommended character level: **1**.

---

## 1.2 Atmosphere and Tone

**Tone keywords:** Gothic, oppressive, deceptive safety, quiet dread.

Barovia is Strahd’s prison and his playground. The Death House is a reflection of his land: a predatory building wearing the mask of a once-respectable home.

Your job is not to jump-scare the players constantly, but to make everything feel *wrongly quiet* and *heavy*, like the world itself is holding its breath.

**Important: Do not tell the players this house is a trap.** Let them discover that through play.

---

## 1.3 How to Voice the World Outside

- **General Barovian villagers:**
  - **Voice:** Tired, flat, quiet. Speak a bit slower than normal. Imagine someone who hasn’t slept properly in years.
  - **Emotional baseline:** Resigned fear. People are cautious and avoid eye contact.
  - **Sample filler phrases (for background NPCs):**
    - "Leave it… nothing good comes of questions here."
    - "The mists take who they will."
    - "We live. That is enough."

- **The wind and the environment:**
  - You *narrate* the wind like a character.
  - Describe it as if it’s curious or watching: "the wind prowls" or "fingers of mist curl".

- **Strahd’s unseen presence:**
  - You do **not** need to show Strahd every time.
  - Suggest his presence through:
    - A distant wolf howl that seems to answer the party.
    - A sense of being watched from an upper window.
    - A crow that lands, stares too long, then flies away.

You will have a specific optional Strahd interaction later in this file.

## 1.4 Opening Narration: The Street Before the House

**DM NOTE (Read this block to set the scene when the players finally reach the street with the Death House):**

*The road beneath your boots is little more than packed, black mud and broken cobblestones. The houses that line this narrow street lean together like tired old men, their steep gabled roofs sagging, their shuttered windows like dark, watching eyes.*

*Color is rare here. Most buildings are stained gray by age and constant drizzle. Rotting wooden balconies tilt over the street, some collapsed entirely, their railings hanging like broken ribs. A sour, moist smell hangs in the air — wet wood, old smoke, and something faintly metallic, like dried blood or rust beneath the mud.*

*There are people, but they move quickly and quietly. A hunched woman in a threadbare shawl drags a basket behind her. A man ducks into a doorway as you pass, refusing to meet your eyes. No one calls out. No one smiles. Doors close as you draw near, latches click, and curtains flutter shut.*

*And then, through the haze and the curling mist, you see it.*

*At the end of the street, standing slightly apart from its miserable neighbors, is a tall brick row house. Its dark, slate roof cuts a sharp line against the low, clouded sky. Unlike the others, its windows are not boarded — their glass panes dark and reflective, like deep, still water. A wrought-iron gate, spotted with rust, guards a small front yard choked with weeds and dead shrubs. A black iron fence, tipped with spear-like points, surrounds the property like a cage.*

*For just a moment, the wind dies. The street grows quieter still, as if the town itself is holding its breath while you look upon the house.*

**Prompt the players:**

> "This house stands out from the others — intact, imposing, and strangely watchful. What do you do?"

**Silence prompt:**

- After asking "What do you do?" **wait at least 5–7 seconds in silence**. Do not rush to fill it. Let the players talk to each other.

---

## 1.5 Likely Player Responses and Your Replies (Street View)

Below are common things new players might say, and suggested responses.

**1) "Does it look abandoned?"**

- **DM (Investigation/Perception, no roll needed yet):**
  - *"From here, the house looks… maintained. The brickwork is solid, the windows unbroken, the iron fence still standing. But the yard is dead — the shrubs are brittle and gray, and no candlelight shows behind the glass. You see no smoke from a chimney, no movement inside."*

**2) "Is anyone else on the street reacting to the house?"**

- **DM:**
  - *"You notice that the rare few people still on the street keep their eyes away from it. One man glances in its direction only for a heartbeat, then looks down and hurries off, his shoulders hunched."*

**3) "Can I see anything in the windows?"**

- **DM:**
  - *"From this distance, the glass just reflects the gray sky and the vague shapes of the street. If something is inside, it isn’t coming to the window."*

**4) "Is there any sign of danger?"**

- **DM (no roll, set tone):**
  - *"You don’t see any obvious dangers — no armed guards, no monsters in the street. But there is a weight to the air around the house, a prickle at the back of your neck, as if you are being watched from somewhere you can’t pinpoint."*

**Open-ended prompt:**

> "This place pulls your attention like a magnet, but nothing forces you to go inside. You can approach, investigate from here, avoid it, or do something else entirely. What do you do?"

**Silence prompt:**

- Again, let players talk. Only step in if everyone seems stuck.

If they ignore the house **completely**, see **Section 1.11 Optional Retraction Hook: Luring Them Back** later.

---

## 1.6 Approaching the Gate and Yard

When at least one player decides to move closer:

**Narration (approach):**

*Your boots squelch in the damp mud as you move down the street toward the tall brick house. The closer you get, the more the sounds of the village seem to fade — distant footsteps, a dog’s bark, the creak of a shutter in the wind. By the time you reach the wrought-iron fence, the world feels muffled, like it’s wrapped in cotton and fog.*

*The black iron bars of the fence are cold to the touch, beaded with droplets of mist that cling like dew. Beyond them, the front yard is a tangle of dead, brittle shrubs and yellowed grass. A narrow flagstone path winds through the lifeless garden to a set of stone steps and a heavy wooden front door.*

**Prompt:**

> "You stand at the fence, looking at the house up close now. What do you do?"

**Likely actions and your responses:**

1. **"I open the gate."**
   - *"The gate gives a long, complaining squeal as you push it open. The sound is too loud in the quiet street, and a few distant crows take wing from a nearby rooftop with a rustle of black feathers."*

2. **"I look for any signs or symbols."** (Perception or Investigation, DC 10–12)
   - On success: *"You don’t see any house number or nameplate, but you do notice the faint outline of something carved above the door — worn letters, too far away to read clearly from here."*
   - On failure: *"From here, you don’t see any markings — just aged brick and silent windows."*

3. **"I listen for sounds inside."** (Perception, DC 12)
   - Success: *"You think you hear a faint sound, like something shifting deep inside the house. It might just be the old structure settling… or something moving."*
   - Failure: *"You hear only the whisper of the wind curling around the eaves of the house and the soft drip of moisture from the iron fence."*

**Open-ended prompt:**

> "The gate stands open now. The path leads up through the dead shrubs to the front steps. Do you go in, look around the yard, or do something else?"

**Silence prompt:** Let players discuss. Only nudge gently if they stall.

---

## 1.7 Introducing Rose and Thorn (Ghost Children Outside)

In the official Curse of Strahd, the ghost children are outside the house. They are named **Rosevalda (Rose) Durst** and **Thornboldt (Thorn) Durst**.

They appear as living children at first, not obviously ghosts. They are manifestations of the house and the tragedy that happened within.

### 1.7.1 How to Play Rose and Thorn

- **Rose (older sister, about 10):**
  - **Voice:** Slightly formal, a little prim. Soft but controlled. Think of a child trying very hard to be "grown up." Avoid being squeaky.
  - **Emotional tone:** Worried but trying to be brave. Protective of her brother. Speaks more than Thorn.
  - **Posture/acting:** Sit or stand a little straighter. Fold your hands. When she’s uncertain, have her smooth a dress that isn’t really there or tuck hair behind her ear.

- **Thorn (younger brother, about 7):**
  - **Voice:** Quiet, timid, slightly nasal or shaky. Occasional sniffles.
  - **Emotional tone:** Frightened, clinging to Rose, easily upset.
  - **Posture/acting:** Hunch your shoulders a little. Hug your arms close to your chest. Look down when you speak as Thorn.

### 1.7.2 Triggering Their Appearance

Trigger Rose and Thorn once the characters:

- Open the gate **or**
- Start walking up the path to the front door **or**
- Clearly show interest in the house but hesitate

**Narration (appearance of the children):**

*As you step onto the path, mist curls around your boots like pale fingers. A sudden draft of cold air pushes down the street, rattling the dead shrubs… and then you hear it: the thin, hitching sob of a child.*

*On the sidewalk just beyond the gate, a little girl in a simple, old-fashioned dress stands with her arms wrapped around a much smaller boy. The girl’s hair is neatly tied back with a faded ribbon. The boy hides his face against her shoulder, his small fingers clutching at her clothes. Both children are pale and thin, their eyes too serious for their young faces.*

*The girl looks up at you, her lips pressed together in a tight, brave line.*

**Prompt:**

> "The girl watches you carefully, holding her brother close. What do you do?"

Allow the players to choose who speaks first.

### 1.7.3 Rose and Thorn’s Initial Dialogue

Below is **scripted dialogue** you can read word-for-word.

**If a character gently speaks first (for example, "Are you all right?" or "Hello there")**:

- **As Rose (soft, careful):**
  - *"We… we’re not supposed to talk to strangers."*
  - *(Pause a moment, as if reconsidering.)*
  - *"But… you look like adventurers. Strong ones."*

- **As Thorn (muffled against Rose):**
  - *"Rose, I don’t like them… what if they’re bad?"*

- **As Rose, soothing Thorn:**
  - *"Shh, Thorn. They might help us."*

- **As Rose, to the party:**
  - *"Our house is haunted. There’s a monster in the basement. Our parents went to fight it, but… they haven’t come back."*
  - *"We can’t go back in. It’s not safe for us."*

**If the party is suspicious or hostile ("What are you doing here?" in a harsh tone):**

- **As Thorn (frightened):**
  - *"Rose, let’s go, please…"*

- **As Rose (defensive, offended but still needing help):**
  - *"We live here! Or… we did. This is our house."*  
  - *"There’s a monster in the basement. Our parents locked it away, but it’s angry. They went down to stop it, and we’re not allowed in the house anymore."*

### 1.7.4 Information Rose and Thorn Can Provide

They **believe** the following (this matches the book’s lore but from their POV):

- They are the **Durst children**.
- They think their parents are still alive downstairs.
- They call the entity in the basement **“the monster”**, and they are genuinely afraid of it.
- They will **insist** the house is dangerous, but they also **want help**.

**When players ask questions, use these sample Q&A.**

---

## 1.8 Likely Questions for the Children and Rose/Thorn Responses

Use these directly or adapt.

**Q1: "What are your names?"**

- **As Rose:**
  - *"I’m Rosevalda Durst. This is my brother, Thornboldt. You can call us Rose and Thorn."*

**Q2: "Where are your parents?"**

- **As Rose:**
  - *"They went to the basement. To deal with the monster."*

- **As Thorn (whispering):**
  - *"They said we were to stay in our room. They locked the door. But then everything got… quiet."*

**Q3: "What monster?"**

- **As Rose:**
  - *"A horrible thing in the basement. It growls and scratches at the walls. Sometimes it screams. It frightens Thorn."*

- **As Thorn:**
  - *"It sounds hungry."*

**Q4: "Why can’t you go back inside?"**

- **As Rose (looking at the house, voice tightening):**
  - *"We’re… we’re not allowed. The house won’t let us. It’s… different now."*
  - *(If pressed further and you want to keep it vague:)*
  - *"We can’t go past the front door. Not really. But you can. Please… you have to help us."*

**Q5: "What’s inside the house?"**

- **As Rose:**
  - *"Our home. Our nursery. The dining room. Father’s study. Guests used to come, a long time ago. But…"*
  - *(She swallows.)*  
  - *"There are… other things there now. The house is angry. It changes."*

**Q6: "How long have you been out here?"**

- **As Rose (confused):**
  - *"We… we don’t know. The fog came, and then everything felt strange. Time feels strange. Sometimes it feels like we’ve always been here."*

**Q7: "What do you want us to do?"**

- **As Rose (earnest, pleading):**
  - *"Please. Go into the house. Find our parents. Stop the monster in the basement. Then maybe… maybe everything can go back to the way it was."*

**Q8: "Is anyone else in there?"**

- **As Rose:**
  - *"The servants, maybe. We haven’t seen them… but sometimes we hear footsteps."*

**Q9: "Are you… really alive?"** (if a player is suspicious)

- **As Rose (defensive, doesn’t understand):**
  - *"Of course we are. We’re just… cold."*

- **As Thorn:**
  - *"My hands are always cold now."*

**Open-ended prompt after Q&A:**

> "The little girl stands there, clutching her brother, her eyes fixed on you with desperate hope. The house looms behind them, its dark windows like watching eyes. What do you do?"

**Silence prompt:** Stay silent for a while. Let the weight of the situation push the players to decide.

## 1.9 Optional Early Strahd Interaction (Distant, Non-Lethal)

This is an **optional** scene you can use **if you want Strahd to appear early**, as a distant, observing presence. If you prefer to keep him mysterious for now, you may skip this section.

Trigger this after the players speak with the children, especially if they agree to go inside.

### 1.9.1 How to Play Strahd at a Distance

- **Voice:** Smooth, confident, controlled. A mild accent of your choosing (eastern European, aristocratic) but don’t overdo it.
- **Emotion:** Amused curiosity. He is *not* threatened by the party. They are toys, or potential rivals, but very amusing ones.
- **Presence:** Even when he’s not physically in front of them, treat his voice like it cuts through the mist.

### 1.9.2 The Raven on the Rooftop (Strahd’s Scrying)

**Narration (use if you want Strahd to “watch” them):**

*As your conversation with the children trails off, a low, rolling growl of thunder murmurs somewhere above the thick clouds. A lone dark shape circles lazily overhead — a large raven, its black feathers slick and glossy against the gray sky.*

*It spirals downward and lands on the peak of the Death House’s roof, talons scraping softly on the slate. The bird tilts its head, fixing you with one bright, intelligent eye. For a heartbeat, it feels less like an animal and more like someone staring at you through a keyhole.*

**Prompt:**

> "The raven watches you in perfect stillness, its head cocked, as if listening. What do you do?"

If a character addresses the bird directly:

- **As Strahd’s distant voice (only the addressed PC hears it clearly; others may hear just a whisper):**
  - *"How interesting… New lambs in my pasture."*  
  - *"Go on, then. Step inside. Every house in my land has its secrets."*

**Acting note:**

- Lower your voice a little. Speak slowly, savoring each word. Imagine Strahd is privately amused.

If the players look for the source of the voice:

- *"You glance around, but see no one new on the street. The raven ruffles its feathers, gives a harsh caw, and takes wing, vanishing into the low clouds."*

This scene doesn’t change mechanics; it simply reinforces that **Barovia and Strahd are watching**.

## 1.10 Investigating the Exterior of the House

Before they enter, players may want to search around the outside.

You can let them:

- Circle the house
- Check windows
- Knock on the door
- Look for alternate entrances

### 1.10.1 Walking the Perimeter

**Narration:**

*You move away from the front gate and follow the narrow strip of muddy ground around the side of the house. The walls here are close to their neighbors, leaving only a thin passage where the wind squeezes through, carrying the smell of damp stone and old rot.*

*The brickwork is stained dark with age, and thick veins of black ivy cling to the walls like grasping hands. Windows along the sides are shuttered or curtained from the inside. None show light.*

**If they try to peer in windows:** (The house doesn’t reveal much yet.)

- *"You press your face close to the glass. Inside, you can just make out shapes — furniture, a long hallway — but the details blur in the gloom. Your own pale reflection stares back at you, ghost-like in the window."*

### 1.10.2 Finding Other Doors or Entrances

By the book, there are no easy, welcoming alternate entrances that bypass the main sequence; treat windows and side doors as **stubborn and resistant**.

If they search for another way (Investigation DC 15):

- On success:
  - *"You find the suggestion of a back door — a heavy wooden door with a rusted handle. When you tug at it, it doesn’t budge. It feels like the entire house is braced against you."*
- On failure:
  - *"You circle the building, but find only blank walls, shuttered windows, and damp brick. If there is another way in, it doesn’t reveal itself to you."*

If they attempt to force or break a back door or window:

- Allow attempts (Strength check DC 18, tools may help).  
- **On failure:**
  - *"You throw your weight against the door, but it might as well be part of the stone foundation. Pain shoots through your shoulder, and the door doesn’t even shudder."*
- **On success:** You can either:
  - Let it open but lead into the same early floors (if you’re comfortable deviating slightly), **or**
  - Have the house resist unnaturally:
    - *"For a moment, you feel the door give — and then a sudden, impossible pressure slams it back into its frame. A wave of nausea rolls over you, and you hear the faintest whisper in your ear: 'Not yet.'"*

> **DM Guidance:** For a new DM, it is simpler to gently funnel them to the **front door** as the primary entrance.

### 1.10.3 Knocking at the Front Door

If a player knocks instead of just going inside:

- *"Your knuckles rap against the heavy wood with a dull, hollow thud. The sound echoes faintly inside the house, then dies away. No answer comes. No footsteps approach."*

**Optional eerie hint:**

- After a few seconds: *"You think you hear the faint sound of distant, muffled music from somewhere deep inside the house. A slow, sad waltz played on an old, out-of-tune instrument. Then it fades."*

**Prompt:**

> "No one answers your knock. The children watch you anxiously. The front door stands closed. What do you do?"

---

## 1.11 Optional Retraction Hook: Luring Them Back to the House

If your players choose to **walk away from the house entirely**, use the mists and the unnatural nature of Barovia to guide them back without removing their sense of agency.

**Goal:** Make it feel like the world is funneling them here, not that you are punishing them.

### 1.11.1 Walking Away

If they leave the street:

**Narration:**

*You turn your back on the tall brick house and make your way down the crooked, muddy street. The air grows colder with every step. Mist pools thickly around your boots, rising higher, swirling in slow, deliberate curls.*

*You pass sagging houses with boarded windows, doorways hanging open like broken mouths. The faces you saw before are gone now. No footsteps, no muttered voices. Just the low moan of the wind and the soft, wet slap of your own boots.*

After a few turns:

- *"You turn a corner, expecting to find a new row of houses… and instead, you see a familiar sight: a tall brick house with a rusted iron fence and dead shrubs clawing at the front yard. The mist coils thicker here, hugging the ground in strange patterns."*

**Prompt:**

> "By all your reckoning, you should be walking away from this place. Yet here it stands before you again — the same house, the same iron fence, the same dark windows. What do you do?"

If they stubbornly keep trying to leave, escalate the surreal feeling:

- *"You spend what feels like an hour walking the streets of this village. No matter which way you turn, the streets bend and fold back on themselves. And sooner or later, the tall brick house waits for you again, like a spider at the center of its web."*

Gently communicate that **this is a key entry into Barovia’s story**.

**Optional Strahd whisper here:**

- *"You hear a voice, distant and amused, like someone speaking through a dream: 'You are already mine, little wanderers. Best to start where the house invites you.'"*

---

## 1.12 The Front Steps and Door: Final Approach

When the players *finally* decide to go in.

**Narration:**

*You climb the short set of stone steps that lead up to the front door. The air feels colder here, pressed close against the dark wood of the house. The door itself is tall and heavy, framed in decorative stonework worn smooth by age. Above it, barely visible in the dim light, are the faint, eroded carvings of twisting vines and roses.*

*The iron doorknob is dark with age but polished where many hands have turned it. A brass knocker shaped like a snarling wolf’s head hangs at eye level, its eyes empty and cold.*

**Prompt:**

> "You stand at the door of the Death House. The street behind you is quiet, the children watching from the sidewalk. The doorknob waits in front of you. What do you do?"

If they hesitate, let the children push gently:

- **As Rose (calling softly):**
  - *"Please… you *are* going to help us, aren’t you?"*

- **As Thorn (small voice):**
  - *"Don’t leave us alone again…"*

**Silence prompt:**

- Say nothing else for a few breaths. Let the players make this choice.

---

## 1.13 Opening the Door (Entering the House)

When a player finally opens the door:

**No check is needed.** The house *wants* them inside.

**Narration as the door opens:**

*Your fingers close around the cold metal of the doorknob. For a moment, there is a faint resistance — like a held breath — and then the knob turns smoothly in your hand.*

*The heavy door swings inward on silent hinges, revealing a dark front hall beyond. The smell of old wood, dust, and something faintly sweet — like long-faded perfume — rolls out to meet you.

*A small gust of wind curls through the doorway, stirring your clothes and whispering across the porch. Behind you, the street feels suddenly distant, as if separated by more than a single threshold.*

**At this point, STOP and mark the transition.** The next file will handle interior exploration.

**Prompt:**

> "The doorway yawns before you, the interior swallowed in dimness. The children stand outside, watching you with wide eyes. Do you step inside?"

**If they do:**

- *"You cross the threshold into the Death House…"*  
  - **END THIS FILE HERE and continue in the next file** (e.g., `04-Death-House-1st-Floor.md`).

**If they back away at the last second:**

- Treat it as hesitation; return to prompts in **Section 1.11** if they try long-term avoidance.

---

## 1.14 Encounters, Checks, and Loot (Exterior Only)

### 1.14.1 Encounters

There are **no mandatory combat encounters** outside the Death House in this stage. This is primarily a roleplay and atmosphere scene.

You may, however, use the following **optional, very minor encounter** if the players need a jolt of danger.

#### Optional Encounter: Mist-Rats in the Alley

Trigger if players spend a long time circling the house or searching alleys.

- **Creatures:** 3–5 **giant rats** (Monster Manual) or reskinned as **“mist rats”**.
- **Battlefield Layout:**
  - Narrow alley between Death House and a neighboring building.
  - Single-file or two-abreast movement.
  - Piles of broken crates and trash that provide half-cover.

**Narration (before combat):**

*As you squeeze through the narrow gap between buildings, your boots slosh in stagnant, foul-smelling water. Something skitters just out of sight. Then you hear the high-pitched squeal of rats — many rats — echoing off the damp brick.*

*Pale shapes dart through the mist at your feet. Then one the size of a small dog lunges into view, patches of fur missing, red eyes gleaming hungrily.*

**Initiative.** Use standard **giant rat** stats.

**Tactics:**

- They swarm the nearest character.
- Retreat if reduced to 1/3 of original numbers.

**Loot:**

- 1d4 **copper pieces** in the muck (breadcrumb trail of past victims).  
- A **rusted locket** worth 5 gp if cleaned, showing a faded portrait of an unknown Barovian.

### 1.14.2 Saving Throws

- No mandatory saving throws in this exterior scene.
- If you use the **Strahd whisper** or **house resisting door** as mental effects, you may allow a **DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) or (Perception)** check to notice something is *wrong*, but not truly resist it. This is for flavor, not for blocking progress.

### 1.14.3 Prices and Economy (If Players Ask Here)

If players already start asking about prices for things in the village, you can use these basic Barovian prices (all in gp, as per the Player’s Handbook, but feel free to mention them as "overpriced" due to scarcity):

- Simple meal at a poor inn (later in village of Barovia proper): ~5 sp
- Bottle of sour Barovian wine: 1 gp
- Basic adventuring gear (rope, torches, etc.): normal PHB price, **if** they find a willing seller.

At this stage, **no one outside** near the Death House is eager to trade with them. You can say:

- *"People here avoid conversation and hurry past you. No one lingers long enough to sell you anything."*

---

## 1.15 Campaign Triggers (Exterior Stage)

Use the following triggers to track campaign state.

1. **Trigger: Party has met Rose and Thorn.**
   - Mark in your notes when they speak with the children.  
   - This means the house is now "aware" of them.

2. **Trigger: Party has tried to leave the Death House street and been redirected by the mists.**
   - This reinforces Barovia’s imprisonment and Strahd’s control.

3. **Trigger: Optional Strahd Observation Completed.**
   - If you used the raven/voice scene, note that Strahd has taken an early interest in the party.

4. **Tarokka Reading Dependencies:**
   - If you have **already run the Tarokka reading** earlier in your campaign (unusual but possible), you can tie the house to specific cards:  
     - **If the Seer (or other knowledge card) was drawn:**
       - The house may whisper small hints about Barovia’s past in later rooms.  
     - **If a card tied to Strahd’s lair or history was drawn:**
       - Consider having a fleeting vision in a window — Strahd’s silhouette in an upper room of the house, even though he is not really there.
   - For most groups, the Tarokka reading happens **later**, so you can safely ignore this for now.

---

## 1.16 Final DM Notes for This Stage

- Your main goals here are to:
  1. Establish **Barovia’s oppressive atmosphere**.
  2. Present the **Death House as both inviting and wrong**.
  3. Introduce **Rose and Thorn** sympathetically.
  4. Give the players a clear **hook**: "Help the children by exploring the house and dealing with the monster in the basement."
- Don’t rush them inside. Give them time to talk, question, and creep themselves out.
- Use silence and stillness as tools. Let them feel watched.

When they finally step through the doorway, move on to the next file, which will guide you room-by-room through the **first floor of the Death House**.
