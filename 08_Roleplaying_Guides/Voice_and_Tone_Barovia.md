# Roleplaying Guide: Voice and Tone in Barovia

- **Narrator Voice:** Speak as if reading a solemn folktale. Slow cadence, occasional rasp.
- **Strahd:** Controlled baritone; savor sibilants. Rare laughter, more smiles of threat.
- **Villagers:** Short phrases, wary glances. Add soft accent and speak as if cold.
- **Ravens:** Sharp caws; use taps and clicks for emphasis.
- **Wolves:** Low growls and sniffs before barks; use knuckle raps on table for paws.

## Body Language Suggestions
- Hunch when portraying villagers; straighten spine for Strahd.
- Use two fingers as “eyes” when describing unseen watchers.
- For tension, clasp your own forearm as if warding off chill.

## Emotional Palette by Scene
- **Road Entry:** Dread and curiosity.
- **Burgomaster’s Home:** Grim resolve with flickers of hope.
- **Siege:** Controlled panic; forced calm between bangs on the door.
