# Raven Scouts (Keeper Messengers)

## Identity
- **Type:** Flock of intelligent ravens loyal to the Keepers of the Feather.
- **Presentation:** Watchful birds with unusually coordinated movements; one wears a thin silver thread around the leg.
- **Voice:** Caws, clicks, and tapping beaks. Translate via druidic magic or animal handling gestures.

## Role and Motivation
- **Goals:** Guide worthy heroes, mislead Strahd’s spies, carry small objects.
- **Behaviors:** Circle above camps, leave feathers as signals, peck at windows when wanting attention.

## Knowledge and Secrecy
- **Know:** Safe paths avoiding patrols, locations of shrines, rumors from Vallaki.
- **Share Freely:** Warnings of wolves or undead nearby, directions toward friendly shelters.
- **Only Share After Trust (Animal Handling DC 14 or Speak with Animals):** Identity of the Keepers and the existence of their roost in Vallaki.

## Interaction Tips
- **Gaining Trust:** Offer breadcrumbs or shiny trinkets. Keep movements slow. Mimic a short caw followed by two taps on the table to represent their reply rhythm.
- **Player Questions:**
  - **“Can you lead us?”** → They flutter and wait; grant advantage on Survival checks if followed.
  - **“Is Strahd near?”** → They croak once for yes, twice for no; may refuse if Strahd is present.

## Combat Notes
- **Avoid Direct Fights:** They scatter unless dominated by magic. If forced, use swarm of ravens stats but halve HP to keep stakes low.
- **Environmental Advantage:** In forests and rooftops they can tail foes unnoticed (DC 15 Perception to spot).
