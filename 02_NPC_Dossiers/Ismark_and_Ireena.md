# Ismark Kolyanovich & Ireena Kolyana

## Shared Context
- **Home:** Village of Barovia, Burgomaster's house.
- **Belief:** Strahd’s attention is doom; outsiders represent slim hope.

## Ismark Kolyanovich (The Lesser)
- **Appearance:** Sturdy human male, early 30s, weary eyes, perpetually unshaven.
- **Voice and Demeanor:** Tired but determined; speak with tight throat, quick sentences. Hands tremble when idle.
- **Motivations:** Protect Ireena, honor his late father, beg outsiders for aid.
- **What He Knows:** Strahd visits at night; Ireena was bitten twice; the village priest is shaken; the cemetery has stirring dead.
- **Will Share:** Offers shelter, pleads for escorting Ireena to safer ground (church or Vallaki).
- **Checks:**
  - **Persuasion DC 12** to gain his trust with plans to defend the house.
  - **Intimidation DC 14** makes him bristle; he refuses assistance if bullied.
- **Combat Behavior:** Fights defensively with longsword, stays near Ireena, calls for help when below half HP.

## Ireena Kolyana
- **Appearance:** Young human woman, striking auburn hair, faint puncture scars on neck.
- **Voice and Demeanor:** Clear, brave, formal; hold head high, shoulders squared. Occasional distant stare when recalling dreams.
- **Motivations:** Prove agency beyond being a target, see the Morninglord’s light, understand her recurring dreams of a ballroom.
- **What She Knows:** Strahd’s voice in her mind; wolves watch the house; letter from Burgomaster asks for help (handout suggested).
- **Will Not Share Easily:** Her fear that she may want to answer Strahd’s call (DC 15 Insight or Persuasion to learn).
- **Checks:**
  - **Persuasion DC 13** to convince her to flee the valley temporarily.
  - **Deception DC 14** to hide risks from her; success means she follows, failure earns distrust.
- **Combat Behavior:** Uses rapier if trained; otherwise Aid another. Gains advantage when fighting beside a trusted PC.

## Dialogue Prompts
- **Ismark Introduction:** “You survived the road? Then perhaps you can survive what stalks my sister.”
- **Ireena’s Resolve:** “I will not be gifted to that monster. If this is my curse, I will choose how I bear it.”
- **Common Player Questions:**
  - **“Who is Strahd?”** → “The lord of this land. He toys with us, but we endure.”
  - **“Why stay?”** → Ireena: “Because running only tightens his grip. We need allies, not hiding.”
  - **“How can we help?”** → Escort to consecrated ground; seek weapons of sunlight; rally villagers.

## Branching Outcomes
- **Agree to Escort:** They become loyal allies; Ismark offers coin and food, Ireena offers local rumors.
- **Refuse Help:** House becomes siege site later; Strahd may mock PCs for inaction.
- **Overbearing Control:** If PCs attempt to imprison Ireena “for safety,” she resists socially and may slip away at night.
