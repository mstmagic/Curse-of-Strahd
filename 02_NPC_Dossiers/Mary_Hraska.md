# Mary Hraska (Mad Mary)

## Identity
- **Age:** Late 50s Barovian woman
- **Appearance:** Thin, gray hair in tangled braid, hollow cheeks, red-rimmed eyes.
- **Voice:** Trembling whispers rising to sudden wails. Rock gently while speaking to mimic grief.

## Personality and Motivation
- **Core:** Consumed by loss of daughter (Gertruda). Oscillates between pleading and blaming outsiders.
- **Goals:** Find any sign of her daughter; cling to hope through outsiders.
- **Triggers:** Loud noises cause her to slam shutters; gentle empathy calms her.

## Knowledge and Secrets
- **Knows:** Her daughter ran toward the castle weeks ago; Vistani sometimes take people away; the sobbing keeps neighbors distant.
- **Does Not Know:** Her daughter’s fate; Strahd’s direct involvement.
- **Will Share Freely:** Description of Gertruda, plea for help, rumors of a golden gown seen on the road.
- **Requires DC 12 Persuasion:** To get her to hand over Gertruda’s locket (holy symbol inside; minor trinket granting +1 to saving throws vs fear for 1 hour once per day).

## Interaction Beats
- **Greeting:** Through a cracked door: “Go away… unless you’ve seen her? Have you seen my little bird?”
- **If Comforted (medicine, tea, calm emotions):** She becomes coherent, offers rumor about the churchyard dead stirring at night.
- **If Threatened:** She shrieks, collapsing; neighbors gather, disapproving PCs.

## Player Questions & Responses
- **“Where did she go?”** → “Toward the road… toward the castle. She said she wanted a storybook life.”
- **“Why didn’t you stop her?”** → “I tried. The Mists stole her will. You must be stronger than I.”
- **“Any clues?”** → “A Vistana with a blue scarf spoke to her days before. They watch the crossroads.”

## Checks and Influence
