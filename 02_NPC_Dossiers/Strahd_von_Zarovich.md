# Strahd von Zarovich — Lord of Barovia

## Identity
- **Species:** Vampire (ancient)
- **Apparent Age:** Mid-40s
- **Presentation:** Regal, predatory grace; dark hair, pale skin, eyes like garnets in low light.
- **Voice:** Controlled baritone, accented; savor consonants. Smile rarely reaches eyes.

## Personality and Drives
- **Beliefs:** Barovia is his domain; guests are pieces in his endless game. Sees himself as betrayed hero.
- **Goals:** Test and break hopeful heroes, claim Ireena’s soul, stave off ennui with elaborate hunts.
- **Motivations:** Control, obsession with Tatyana’s reincarnations, need for worthy opponents.
- **Mood Shifts:** Calm calculation → cold fury if thwarted → amused cruelty when in control.

## Knowledge and Secrets
- **Knows:** Every route in the valley, most active NPCs, the party’s movements once they make noise.
- **Does Not Know:** Exact locations of hidden holy relics until scouted; players’ personal histories.
- **Will Share Freely:** Polite welcomes, backhanded compliments, offers of hospitality.
- **Withheld Unless Pried (DC 17 Insight or Persuasion):** Hints that he is bound by invitation rules, aversions to sunlight and running water.

## Interaction Guidance
- **Greeting Script:** “Welcome to Barovia. I hope you will make this land… interesting again.” Maintain still posture, steeple fingers.
- **Questions to Ask PCs:** “What do you desire most?” “Whom do you fear?” “Shall we make a wager?”
- **Common Player Requests & Responses:**
  - **Demand safe passage:** Offers conditional freedom if they entertain him with feats or riddles.
  - **Seek alliance:** Feigns interest, sets impossible tasks; betrayal later.
  - **Attack:** Uses charm first; retreats as mist or bat if significantly threatened.

## Mechanical Notes (5e)
- **Key Abilities:** Legendary resistances (3/day), legendary actions (move, unarmed strike, frighten), lair actions when at Castle Ravenloft.
- **Combat Behavior:** Opens with charm or frighten, isolates a target, commands wolves/bats. Avoids prolonged melee until odds favor him.
- **Weaknesses:** Sunlight hypersensitivity, running water damage, barred from entering dwellings uninvited, stake through the heart while incapacitated.
- **Alternate Difficulty:** For low-level glimpses, treat him as CR 10 projection with reduced legendary resistances (1/day) and reduced damage.

## Roleplay Patterns
- **Tells:** Taps finger when bored; eyes flash red when amused. Rarely raises voice; whispers when enraged.
- **Body Language:** Stand tall, minimal movement. When mock-friendly, offer a toast gesture with an invisible goblet.
- **Emotional Beats:**
  - **Intrigued:** Lean forward slightly, soften consonants.
  - **Disappointed:** Sigh, glance past the speaker as if already thinking of another pawn.
  - **Angry:** Lower voice further; smile without warmth and make short, decisive statements.

## Persuasion and Intimidation Benchmarks
- **Flattery to buy time:** DC 15 Persuasion to gain a momentary stay of execution or a hint.
- **Threats:** DC 18 Intimidation to make him retreat temporarily; failure provokes a legendary action.
- **Bribery:** Offers of rare lore or relics may grant advantage on social checks if plausible.
