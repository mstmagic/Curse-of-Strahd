- **Social Web**: Allies, enemies, dependents; links to other dossiers.
- **Knowledge Matrix**:
  - Knows / Doesn’t Know / Thinks They Know (misconceptions)
  - Willing to Share / Reluctant to Share / Won’t Share
  - Associated ability checks and DCs to extract, coerce, or deceive.
- **Tactics & Combat**: Full stat block or derived-from-monster template, plus tactics.
