# Recurring Motifs and Foreshadowing

- **Wolves and Ravens:** Appear every session—either sight, sound, or object. Use raven feathers as safe-path hints; wolf prints to signal danger.
- **The Mists:** Brief tendrils appear in corners indoors; windows fog when Strahd’s attention turns toward a scene.
- **Nightmares:** Offer short dream snippets after stressful nights: ballroom echoes, falling bells, crimson rivers. Note outcomes in 06_Campaign_Trackers/Session_Log_Template.md.
- **Prophecy Hints:** Unreadable cards, chanting from Tser Pool, and strangers muttering rhymes about “sunlight in stone.”
- **Religion and Ruin:** Cracked holy symbols, candles guttering, bells ringing without hands.
- **Curses and Bargains:** Villagers warn that every gift in Barovia has a price. Enforce with small costs (exhaustion risk, lost trinket, or whispered secret).

## Deployment Tips
- Insert one motif every 15–20 minutes of play.
- Tie motifs to choices: accepting wolf bait leads to ambush; following raven sign avoids it.
- Keep notes to repeat elements so players feel watched.
