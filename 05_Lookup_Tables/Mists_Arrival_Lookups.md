## 1.2 Atmospheric Details by Check Type

Use these when players investigate the environment upon first entering Barovia.

### 1.2.1 Perception (General)
- **DC 10:** Distant wolf howls, unnatural quiet between gusts of wind.
- **DC 13:** Faint sound of a creaking wagon far away; flutter of unseen wings above.
- **DC 15+:** Brief glimpse of red eyes between trees; sense of being watched from multiple directions.

### 1.2.2 Survival (Tracking & Signs)
- **DC 10:** Old wagon ruts and boot prints along the road.
- **DC 13:** Signs of a recent struggle—drag marks leading toward the forest.
- **DC 15+:** Disturbed earth where something was buried shallowly and then dug up again.

### 1.2.3 Arcana / Religion (Nature of the Mists)
- **DC 10:** The mists feel magical and unnatural.
- **DC 13:** They are suffused with necrotic energy; likely tied to a powerful curse.
- **DC 15+:** The mists feel *selective*—not simply wild magic, but **guided**, as if by a will.

## 1.3 Emotional State Prompts

Use these lines to quickly color how the environment presses on a character's inner life.

Roll 1d6 when a character has a quiet moment in the mists:

1. **Oppressive Weight:** "For a moment, you feel as though the air itself is pushing down on your shoulders, urging you to kneel."
2. **Homesick Echo:** "You catch the scent of something that reminds you of home—baking bread, pipe smoke, a familiar flower—but when you turn, there is nothing there."
3. **Unseen Footsteps:** "You could swear you hear a second set of footsteps matching yours exactly, though no one is there."
4. **Whispered Name:** "Somewhere in the gray, you hear your name spoken in a voice you almost recognize. Almost."
5. **Time Slip:** "You suddenly cannot recall how long you have been walking. Minutes? Hours? The question makes your stomach drop."
6. **Lingering Eyes:** "You get the unshakable feeling that someone is standing just behind you. When you spin around, there is only mist."

## 1.4 Random Roadside Oddities (Non-Combat)

Roll 1d8 when you want to break up travel without a full encounter.

1. **Abandoned Lantern:** A dented metal lantern lies in the mud, its glass cracked. When lit, its flame burns a sickly, bluish white.
2. **Child's Toy:** A small wooden soldier with one arm missing, half-buried in the dirt. Faint initials are carved into the base.
3. **Raven Feather Cluster:** A small bundle of raven feathers tied together with red thread hangs from a low branch, spinning slowly with no wind.
4. **Half-Finished Grave:** A shallow pit beside the road, as if someone began digging a grave and then stopped abruptly. The soil is damp and undisturbed.
5. **Old Campfire Circle:** The blackened stones of a long-cold campfire. No footprints remain, as if time itself erased them.
6. **Crumpled Letter:** A weather-stained scrap of parchment, almost illegible. A few words remain: "...cannot escape... he sees... please..." 
7. **Broken Cart Wheel:** A cart wheel leaning against a tree, its spokes cracked. Claw marks score the wood.
8. **Hanging Wind Chime:** Bones and rusted metal pieces tied together. It should rattle in the wind, but it swings silently.
