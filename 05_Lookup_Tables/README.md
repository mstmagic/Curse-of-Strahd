# 05_Lookup_Tables

Fast-reference tables for everything a Curse of Strahd DM might need to improvise or accelerate play, including but not limited to:

- Atmospheric details (fog, sounds, scents, unsettling sights)
- Barovian rumors and superstitions
- Random Strahd appearances and omens
- Road, forest, and village complications
- NPC quirks, secrets, and quick personalities
- Trinkets, letters, visions, and nightmare prompts
- Weather, time, and travel pacing

Each table will be a markdown file, clearly labeled with usage examples and cross-references to narration, NPC dossiers, and encounters.
