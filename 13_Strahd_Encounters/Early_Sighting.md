# Strahd Encounter: Early Sighting

## Purpose
Show Strahd as an omnipresent hunter without direct combat.

## Trigger Moments
- After road ambush, during rest near campfire.
- At the gates if party lingers or argues.

## Staging
- **Form:** Bat swarm coalescing into mist silhouette on a ridge; or rider on black horse glimpsed between lightning flashes.
- **Audio:** Whisper on the wind: “Welcome to my table.”
- **Body Language:** Sit back, fold hands, smirk; avoid eye contact to suggest he barely cares.

## Player Interactions
- **If Hailed:** He offers a mock bow and vanishes; leaves black rose.
- **If Attacked:** Magic and arrows pass through mist image; he laughs and compliments the attempt.
- **If Ignored:** He trails them overhead for an hour; drop temperature by a few degrees.

## Outcomes
- Grants 1 point of dread on tracker (note in 06_Campaign_Trackers/Session_Log_Template.md).
- Next wolf encounter gains advantage on first attack due to shared intel.
