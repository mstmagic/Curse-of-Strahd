# Strahd Encounter: Invitation to Dinner

## Timing
Use after the party proves capable (defends Ireena, defeats a major foe) but before final act.

## Delivery
- A black carriage arrives with crimson interior. Driver is silent revenant-like figure.
- Letter handed over (see 11_Items_And_Treasure/Strahd_Note.md for tone; adjust text for formal invite).
- Ravens circle anxiously; one tries to steal the letter but fails unless helped.

## Dialogue Beats
- **Strahd’s Written Words:** “Your deeds entertain me. Join me for dinner in two nights. Come willingly, or I will come for you still hungry.”
- **If PCs Speak to Driver:** He silently points toward Castle Ravenloft; will wait one hour before departing.

## Player Options
- **Accept:** Gain a day of uneasy peace; Strahd reduces direct harassment. Prepare castle scene later.
- **Decline:** Strahd sends werewolf messengers with a burning wagon next night (increase encounter difficulty elsewhere).
- **Delay:** Carriage returns at sunset with louder thunder; failing to decide prompts Strahd to choose a hostage.

## DM Portrayal
- Tone formal and patronizing. Keep posture perfect. Smile only when players show bravery.
