# Storm Over Ravenloft

- **Sounds:** Rolling thunder from afar, occasional lightning flash silhouetting the castle.
- **Visuals:** Forked lightning illuminating clouds; rain as silver threads against black stone.
- **DM Actions:** Snap fingers for lightning, then pause before speaking to simulate thunder delay.
- **Mood:** Majesty and menace; use this to herald Strahd or a major omen.
- **Mechanical Option:** Outdoors, ranged weapon attacks beyond normal range have disadvantage due to wind.
