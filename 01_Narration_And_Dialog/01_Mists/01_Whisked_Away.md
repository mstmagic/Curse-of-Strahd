Voice and Acting: Soft, distant, slowly unnerving. Speak as if a far-off memory, then closer with each sentence. Pause between phrases. Allow long, creeping silences.

Purpose: This recitation triggers when the party first notices the mists or is pulled into Barovia. It should immerse players and provide sensory anchors.

Narration (Start — 0 to 30 seconds):
"The world narrows. The road under your feet becomes a ribbon of gray. The air grows cold; a sweetness—like old graves, or rot long congealed—slides across your tongue. The trees lean in, their branches like arthritic hands. A bell tolls, but distant, as if from the bottom of a well."

Stage Directions for DM: Speak slowly. After each sentence, pause and glance at a different player. Increase the tempo slightly when describing sensations. If players ask sensory questions, answer vividly (see "Common Player Questions" section).

Prompt to Players: "Describe what you clutch as the mist closes. What do you hear from somewhere that is not here?"

If Players Ask 'Where are we?' — Option Responses:
- If you want to keep mystery: "Where do you think? The road you knew disappears, and only the mist remembers the way."
- If hinting: "You step off the road. Ahead—through the gray—there is a light, but it does not promise solace."

Suggested Player Checks:
- Wisdom (Survival) DC 12 to keep bearings (advantage in pairs).
- Perception DC 10 to notice shapes moving in fog.
- Insight DC 13 if an NPC claims to know the road through the mists.

Common Player Questions and Reasonable Answers:
- Q: Can we see our hands? A: Yes, gray and faint; fingertips look like smudges. Your breath is visible.
- Q: Can we leave? A: The road behind is a blur; walking back feels wrong. A DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to resist the compulsion to step forward if you attempt to retrace immediately.

Notes for Staging:
- Use a dimming light or a fan for atmosphere, if available.
- Play low, sustained music if possible — strings, organ drones.

Vanishing Return: After 10 minutes of roleplay or one long rest, the mists settle but keep Barovia's rules: no teleporting off the land without story triggers.

Mini-Adventure Marking: Mark this file: MANDATORY — initial translocation into Barovia. Mini-encounters that can be triggered here are optional and listed in /04_Encounters/Mist_Intro_Encounter.md
