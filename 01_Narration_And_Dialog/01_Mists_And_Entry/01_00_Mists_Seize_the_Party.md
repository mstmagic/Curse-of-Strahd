# 1. Mists Seize the Party

## 1.1 Voice & Demeanor (DM)
- **Voice:** Low, measured, intimate, as though confiding a nightmare. Slow down on sensory details.
- **Demeanor:** Calm but inexorable; the world itself is closing in. When the mists act, speak a little more softly and slowly.

## 1.2 Staging Notes
- Dim the lights or describe them dimming; if possible, lower ambient light at the table.
- Encourage players to say what their characters were doing *just before* the mists appear (camping, on the road, in a city alley, etc.).
- This scene should feel like a dream slipping into a nightmare: familiar things becoming wrong.

## 1.3 Opening Narration: Ordinary World Fraying
Read or paraphrase:

> The world around you is ordinary, almost forgettable. The colors are the ones you’ve always known. The air tastes familiar on your tongue. You can smell [insert current surroundings: campfire smoke / city refuse / forest loam], and for a moment, everything seems as it has always been.
>
> But then… something small goes wrong.

Pause. Ask each player individually, in turn:
- "What is the *last normal thing* your character remembers seeing or doing before everything changes?"

After they answer, continue:

> A chill, thin as a blade, slides down your spine. The sounds around you seem to stretch, then warp, as if heard through water.
> 
> And then you notice the first tendrils of **mist**.

## 1.4 The Mists Appear

### 1.4.1 Core Description
Read or paraphrase slowly:

> At first it is only a suggestion—pale wisps curling around your boots, trailing along the ground like breath on a winter morning. The air cools, not sharply, but steadily, as if some great mouth has opened above you and inhaled the warmth from the world.
>
> The mist thickens. It rolls and coils, dragging ghostly fingers across stone and soil, swallowing color. Greens become gray. Grays become black. The sky, whatever color it was, leaches into a flat, soulless silver.

### 1.4.2 Player Interaction Hooks
After the first description, leave a deliberate pause and say:
- "What do you do?"

**Common Actions & Responses:**

1. **They try to move away from the mist / outrun it.**  
   - Narration:
     > You move quickly—faster, then faster still. But the mist moves with you. Not like fog rolling across a field, but like a patient predator matching your steps. Every direction becomes the same: pale, shifting, empty.
   - Mechanics: If you want a check, call for **DC 12 Survival or Perception** to notice that
     - No matter which direction they go, landmarks repeat or vanish.  
     - Cross-reference: See **06_Campaign_Trackers/01_Mists_And_Entry_Tracker.md – Section 2: Party Orientation in the Mists**.

2. **They call out / listen for others.**  
   - Narration:
     > Your voice sounds wrong in the mist—muffled, as though spoken into cloth. It goes nowhere. It bounces back to you, a half-second late, distorted and thin, as if someone else is repeating your words from just behind your shoulder.
   - If they listen: **DC 13 Perception** check. On success:
     > Beyond the dull echo of your own voice, you hear something else: the faint creak of wood, the distant clop of hooves, or the jingle of a harness—sounds of a road that should not be here.
   - On failure:
     > The silence seems to thicken. No birds. No wind. Just the soft hiss of the mist folding in on itself.

3. **They use magic to disperse or analyze the mist (gust, detect magic, etc.).**  
   - *Non-strong wind effects (e.g., Gust cantrip):*
     > The mist parts before your spell as if pushed by an invisible hand… then curls back into place as soon as the magic fades. It is not natural fog. It is stubborn. Intentional.
   - *Detect Magic or similar:* The mists are strongly magical.
     - **Arcana DC 15:** It feels like a planar boundary, a curtain between places.  
     - **Arcana DC 20:** The magic radiates an oppressive, necromantic-predatory nature; this is not merely a barrier—it is a net.
   - Cross-reference: **05_Lookup_Tables/Mists_Arrival_Lookups.md – Arcane Interpretations of the Mists**.

4. **They cling together / tie ropes / establish marching order.**  
   - Narration:
     > You draw closer, your shapes becoming shadowy silhouettes in the choking gray. Ropes bite gently into your wrists and waists. Each breath leaves a brief hole in the fog before it fills in again. If you let go, you have the sickening feeling you could vanish from each other’s sight in a heartbeat.
   - Mechanics: If anyone strays more than 30 feet, you may separate them briefly (see **04_Encounters/01_Mists_Arrival_Roadside_Encounters.md** for solo or split-party vignettes).

## 1.5 Transition: The World Slips Away

### 1.5.1 Sensory Collapse
Read or paraphrase:

> Time loses its edges. You cannot say how long you have been walking—minutes, hours, or days folded over one another like damp pages of a ruined book. Footsteps dull to a steady, hopeless rhythm.
>
> One by one, familiar things fall away. The smell of [their original environment] is gone. The taste of the air changes: copper and cold stone on your tongue.
>
> The world you knew recedes, not with a scream, but with a sigh.

Pause, then ask the table:
- "In this colorless void, what personal memory does your character cling to in order not to panic?"  
  Allow a moment of roleplay.

Then continue:

> You hold that memory close—a face, a promise, a place—and for a moment, it keeps you whole. But the mist does not care. It presses closer, curling around your thoughts, nibbling at the edges of who you are.

### 1.5.2 Optional Wisdom Saves (Psychological Pressure)
- Ask for **DC 12 Wisdom saving throws** from each character.
- On success:
  > The mist gnaws at your thoughts, but you steel yourself. You know who you are. You will not be swallowed so easily.
- On failure (no mechanical consequence, just flavor unless you wish to impose 1 level of flavor-only exhaustion to roleplay):
  > Something of you slips, just a little. Your hands feel distant, like gloves on someone else’s body. For a moment you are certain there was another road, another choice, another life… and you can’t quite remember its shape.

## 1.6 First Hint of Barovia

### 1.6.1 Foreshadowing Strahd (Invisible Presence)
As the mists thicken, introduce the *feeling* of being watched.

Read or paraphrase:

> There is a moment—just a heartbeat—when the hairs on your arms and neck rise all at once. Something looks at you. Not from ahead. Not from behind. From *above*—from the sky, from the mist itself, from the spaces between your thoughts.
>
> It is ancient. Patient. Amused.

Allow silence. Then:
- "What do you do?"

If any character calls out or challenges the unseen presence:

> Your words vanish into the pall. For a breath, the mist seems to still—as if listening. You feel, rather than hear, a response: quiet, distant laughter, like dry leaves rubbed together.

Cross-reference: This is a **non-visual Strahd presence**, see **02_NPC_Dossiers/Strahd_von_Zarovich.md – Section 3.1: Unseen Omnipresence**.

### 1.6.2 Optional Mini-Adventure Hook: The Lost Carriage (Retraction Tool)
Mark this as **[Mini-Adventure – Retraction Hook #1: The Lost Carriage]**.

Use this when you need to reorient or re-gather a split or wandering party in the mists.

> Through the shifting gray ahead, new shapes take form—dark, blocky silhouettes that rise and fall as if breathing. As you draw nearer, they sharpen into the outline of a road, a shattered milestone, and the corpse of a black carriage half-sunk in mud and roots.

- See **04_Encounters/01_Mists_Arrival_Roadside_Encounters.md – The Lost Carriage** for:
  - Complete encounter layout.
  - Optional undead or animated harness.
  - Clues pointing the party deeper toward Barovia.

## 1.7 Exiting the Mists Toward the Gates of Barovia

Do **not** transition to landmarks until you are ready for them to truly arrive in Barovia proper.

When you are ready, read or paraphrase:

> The mist begins, at last, to thin—not all at once, but in slow, reluctant tatters. Gray shreds peel away from your faces and shoulders, clinging like cobwebs before they finally drift aside.
>
> In their place comes the shape of a road: glossy with damp, rutted with old wagon tracks. On either side, the forest rises like a wall of black spears. The trees are tall and sickly, their branches knotted like arthritic fingers, their leaves colorless and limp.
>
> Somewhere ahead, a lone raven calls once—a harsh, ragged sound—and then nothing.

Pause. Then prompt:
- "You stand upon a forgotten road in a land that does not welcome you. What do you do?"

Transition point: From here, move into the **Arrival Road / Gates of Barovia** scenes.  
Create or consult:
- **01_Narration_And_Dialog/01_Mists_Arrival/01_01_The_Old_Svalich_Road.md** *(to be developed)*
- **04_Encounters/01_Mists_Arrival_Roadside_Encounters.md – Roadside Corpses / Howling Wolves / The Hanging Man**

## 1.8 DM Quick-Use Summary

1. Start in familiar world; let players define last normal moments.  
2. Introduce mists slowly; call for Perception/Survival if they try to navigate.  
3. Undermine senses: sound muffled, colors drained, time uncertain.  
4. Apply optional Wisdom save for psychological pressure.  
5. Foreshadow Strahd as unseen observer (no direct appearance).  
6. Use **[Mini-Adventure – Retraction Hook #1: The Lost Carriage]** if needed to regroup or redirect.  
7. When ready, thin the mists and place them firmly on the Old Svalich Road.
