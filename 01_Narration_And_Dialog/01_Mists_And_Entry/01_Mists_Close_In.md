# 1. Mists Close In – Guided Narration

## 1.1 Voice and Acting Notes

- **Narrator voice**: low, steady, a little tired. Imagine someone telling a ghost story by dying firelight. Avoid big drama; let the words do the work.
- **Pacing**: speak more slowly than you think you should. Allow short silences between paragraphs.
- **Physical acting**: glance past the players occasionally as if you hear something behind them. Lean in a bit when the mist thickens. If possible, dim lights in the room as you read.

No major NPCs speak in this scene yet—only the land and the mists.

## 1.2 Scene Trigger and Setup

This scene begins when the party is traveling on a road in their home world and first notices something strange: a chill wind, low fog, or a crossroads shrouded in gray.

If your previous adventure ended with them accepting a mysterious letter or hook, lead in with a short reminder in your own words, then begin the read‑aloud below.

## 1.3 Read‑Aloud: First Signs of the Mists

> The road beneath your feet feels familiar enough—packed earth, scattered stones, the occasional gnarled root grabbing at your boots. But the day has grown strangely quiet.
>
> Birds that had been calling in the distance fall silent all at once. The breeze dies, leaving the air heavy and still.
>
> A low, white fog lies ahead, clinging to the ground like spilled milk. It curls around tree trunks and seeps over the road in slow‑moving tendrils.
>
> The smell of damp soil and dead leaves grows stronger, as if autumn has arrived in a single breath.

**[STAGE DIRECTION]**: Pause. Look around the table. Let the players react or speak. Then prompt:

**[PLAYER PROMPT]**: “What do you do?”

### 1.3.1 Likely Player Actions and Your Responses

1. **They ignore the fog and keep walking.**  
   Respond with:

   > You press on, boots squelching softly as the soil turns spongy underfoot. The mist parts lazily around you, brushing against your legs like cold, damp cloth.
   >
   > The world behind you begins to blur. When you glance back, the trees and road you came from are already half‑hidden, their colors drained to gray.

2. **They stop and investigate the fog at the edge.**  
   Allow various checks:
   - **Arcana or Nature (DC 13)**: hints that the mist is unnatural.
   - **Survival (DC 11)**: something is wrong with the air and the silence.

   If someone touches the fog lightly:

   > Your fingers vanish up to the knuckles in cold, clinging vapor. It feels damp but not wet—more like breathing on a window in winter. When you pull your hand back, your skin is numb and prickling, as if it had fallen asleep.

   If a check succeeds, share:

   > This isn’t natural ground fog. It doesn’t move with the wind, and it seems to thicken deliberately where you look hardest. You have the sinking feeling that it’s not just weather—it’s **will**.

3. **They retreat or try another direction.**  
   The mists respond like a closing circle.

   > You turn away from the fog and pick another direction. After a few minutes, the trees thin and the air grows lighter… until the same milky curtain of mist appears ahead. It’s as if the land has quietly rotated around you.

   If they test this repeatedly, allow another **Survival (DC 14)** or **Wisdom (DC 12)** check:

   > You’re not walking in circles. The land itself is folding around you, like pages turning in a book you are trapped inside.

**[PLAYER PROMPT]**: After several attempts to evade the fog, or once they accept its presence: “Eventually, the only way that doesn’t lead straight into the mist… is gone. The fog waits. What do you do?”

## 1.4 Entering the Mists Proper

Once the players decide—or resign themselves—to enter:

> The first steps into the fog feel like wading into cold breath. Sound dies around you. Your footfalls are muffled, and even your armor seems reluctant to clink.
>
> The air chills with each step, leeching warmth from your skin. A pale, sourceless light filters through the vapor, flattening shapes and swallowing color.
>
> After a dozen paces, when you look back, there is no sign of where you came from. Only more gray.

**[STAGE DIRECTION]**: If you can, lower the lights a bit more. If you use music, switch to a low, droning track—something that feels like distant wind.

### 1.4.1 Skill Checks and Reassurance

At this point, many players will test whether they are truly trapped.

- **Survival, Navigation, or tracking attempts (DC 15)**:  
  On success:
  > Your instincts say you *should* be able to navigate by habit—same stride, same turns—but the mist refuses to give you points of reference. Landmarks fade behind you as soon as you pass them. You realize that normal methods won’t help you escape.

  On failure:
  > Every direction looks the same. The mist thickens and thins randomly, hiding any sense of distance. You can’t even be sure whether you’re going uphill or down.

- **Arcana or Religion (DC 14)**:  
  On success:
  > You sense a boundary has been crossed. This fog isn’t a simple spell—it’s a wall between worlds, or perhaps a cocoon. Whatever rules applied in the world you knew… they’re slipping away.

Assure the players **they can still act**, but that leaving is not currently an option. Encourage them to focus on staying together, choosing a marching order, and preparing for what’s ahead.

**[PLAYER PROMPT]**: “As the fog closes around you, how are you traveling? Who takes the lead? Who watches the rear? What are you doing to keep track of one another?”

Record any marching order choices in `/06_Campaign_Trackers/01_Mists_And_Entry_Tracker.md` under the “Initial Marching Order” section.

## 1.5 Sensory Beats While Traveling in the Mists

Use the following short descriptions as beats while they walk. Sprinkle them between player conversations or decisions.

1. **Distant Wolves**  
   > Somewhere far ahead—or behind, it’s impossible to tell—a wolf howls. The sound is stretched thin and distorted by the fog, as if heard underwater. Another answers, closer.

2. **Footsteps That Aren’t Theirs**  
   > For a moment, you hear a second set of footsteps, just behind your own. When you stop, it stops. When you whirl around, there is only fog.

3. **Color Drain**  
   > A fallen red leaf lies on the road. As you watch, its color seems to bleach away, leaving it a dead, ashen gray before it crumbles under the slightest touch.

4. **The Mist Breathes**  
   > The fog around you draws backward for a heartbeat, as if inhaling. Then it rolls in again, closer, thicker, pressing you together.

For random additional beats, see `/05_Lookup_Tables/01_Mists_And_Entry/Atmospheric_Dressing_Table.md`.

## 1.6 First Unseen Glimpse of Strahd (Optional)

This is an **optional** early hint that something intelligent is watching. It does **not** reveal Strahd’s identity yet, only his presence.

Trigger this after 10–20 minutes of in‑game travel or after the group has tried and failed to escape the mist.

> The fog thins just enough to reveal a darker shape ahead—a rise in the road, perhaps, or a low hill. Silhouetted against the pale haze is the outline of a mounted figure, motionless.
>
> Horse and rider stand perfectly still. You can’t make out details, only the sharp cut of a cloak and the curve of a helm or high collar.
>
> For a moment, the figure seems to look directly at you.

**[PLAYER PROMPT]**: “What do you do?”

### 1.6.1 Approaching the Figure

If the party advances quickly:

> You hurry forward, the rhythm of your steps swallowed by the fog. The shape of the rider does not move, does not react. The distance feels wrong—one moment close, then suddenly far.
>
> You blink, and the figure is gone. Only the swirling gray remains.

If someone calls out:

> Your voice vanishes into the mist like a stone thrown into deep water. For a heartbeat, there’s no answer.
>
> Then, faintly, from no clear direction, you hear the soft clink of metal and the creak of leather—someone adjusting in a saddle. When you look, there is nothing there.

If they fire a ranged attack or cast a spell:

> The missile vanishes into fog. A heartbeat later, you hear the distant clatter of something striking stone far off and to the side—as if space itself shifted your aim.

This encounter is detailed mechanically in `/04_Encounters/01_Mists_And_Entry/Strahd_Rider_On_The_Ridge.md`. Treat it as non‑combat, purely atmospheric, unless you intentionally escalate.

## 1.7 Transition Toward the Road Through the Mists

Once you feel you’ve lingered long enough in the formless fog, begin to transition toward more defined terrain that will lead to the Old Svalich Road.

Read:

> Time loses meaning in the fog. Your steps blur into one another until you can’t say how long you’ve walked—minutes, hours, or days.
>
> Eventually, the ground underfoot firms. Gravel crunches beneath your boots. The ghost of a road takes shape: a darker band of earth running ahead into the mist.
>
> The fog thins from an impenetrable wall to shifting curtains. You see the crooked silhouettes of trees now, their bare branches clutching at the sky like blackened fingers.

**[STAGE DIRECTION]**: This is your cue to change the battle map or theater‑of‑the‑mind description to a forest road swallowed by mist. Note in your tracker that the party has reached the **Road Through the Mists** scene.

Mark in `/06_Campaign_Trackers/01_Mists_And_Entry_Tracker.md`:
- The approximate in‑game time you think has passed.
- Any exhaustion, fear, or effects applied from the mists (see `/05_Lookup_Tables/01_Mists_And_Entry/Mist_Effects_Table.md`).
- Whether the party saw the rider silhouette.

**[PLAYER PROMPT]**: “As the shape of a road emerges beneath your feet, you realize that—whether you like it or not—you are going *somewhere*. The mist is done with aimless wandering.

> Who takes the lead as you follow this road into the unknown?”

From here, proceed to `/01_Narration_And_Dialog/01_Mists_And_Entry/02_Road_Through_The_Mists.md`.
