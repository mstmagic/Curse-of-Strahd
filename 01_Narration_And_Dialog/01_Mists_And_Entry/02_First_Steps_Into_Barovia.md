# 1. First Steps into Barovia

## 1.1 Voice & Acting Notes
- **Narrator:** Low, measured, almost whispering. Imagine speaking in a cold room where every word hangs in the air. Avoid big emotional swings; keep it restrained and inevitable.
- **Ambient Sounds to Describe:** Distant wolves, dripping water, the settling creak of trees, the occasional caw of unseen crows.
- **DM Physicality:** Stay relatively still. Use slow hand motions to trace the curling of mists, the thin line of the road, or the outline of looming trees.

## 1.2 Scene Overview
- **Chronology:** This scene triggers immediately after the party has been swallowed by the mists and finds themselves on the Old Svalich Road, but **before** reaching the massive gates of Barovia.
- **Goal:** Communicate that they are completely cut off from their previous world, evoke dread and isolation, and invite many moments of player agency.

## 2. Opening Boxed Text: Awakening in the Mists

Use this when the characters first realize the mists have transported them.

> The world goes silent.
> 
> Not quiet—**silent**. The last familiar sounds are snatched away as if someone cut the strings that held them. The air turns cold and damp, clinging to your skin like a wet shroud.
> 
> Pale gray mists coil around your feet, then your knees, then your chest, swallowing the world beyond arm's reach. Your breath steams faintly and is devoured by the fog a heartbeat later.
> 
> When the mists finally thin, you are no longer where you were.
> 
> A narrow, muddy **road of packed earth and broken cobblestone** stretches ahead and behind, swallowed in both directions by towering, twisted trees. Their bare branches knit together high above, forming a skeletal canopy that admits only a weak, ashen light.
> 
> The air smells of **wet soil, rotting leaves, and old smoke**, as if a fire died here a long time ago and never truly went out.
> 
> Somewhere far off in the gloom, you hear the **low, mournful howl of a wolf**, joined by another... and another.
> 
> The mists behind you churn restlessly, curling like grasping fingers any time you look away.

> **Pause.** Look at the players. Let the silence stand for a few seconds, then ask:
> 
> **"What do you do?"**

## 3. Immediate Player Reactions & DM Responses

### 3.1 Inspecting the Mists Behind Them

If players examine or test the mists:

**Common Actions:** Stepping into the mist, throwing objects into it, shouting, listening, tracking their own footprints.

**DM Guidance (Non-Deadly Initial Contact):**
- The mists **resist progress** after a short distance (30–60 feet) and begin to **sting the lungs**.
- The goal here is to communicate entrapment without early cheap character death.

**Narration – Approaching the Mists:**

> The mists seem thin and harmless from here, a soft curtain of gray. But as you step closer, the cold deepens. Each breath burns a little, as if the air itself resents being taken into your lungs.

If they step in partway but not far enough to trigger damage:

> The fog wraps around you like icy wool. Sounds become muffled; even your own voice seems distant. After only a few steps, your outline begins to fade, swallowed by the gray. Instinct screams that if you keep going, you may not find your way back.

If they push farther (5e check/impact per CoS guidance):
- Call for a **Constitution saving throw** (DC 12–15 depending on how punitive you want the mists early on).
- On failure, they cough blood-tinged phlegm, gain a level of **exhaustion** or take a small amount of **necrotic damage** (1d4–1d6), and are forced back toward the road.

> The cold surges into your chest. Your next breath feels like inhaling broken glass. Black motes swim in your vision as your knees weaken, and the mists themselves seem to **push you back**, spitting you out onto the road as if rejecting a foreign body.

**Prompt:**
- After any interaction, return the choice:
  - **"The mists clearly do not want you to leave this place. What do you do now?"**

**Tracking:**
- Log any damage and exhaustion in `06_Campaign_Trackers/01_Mists_And_Entry_Tracker.md` under the `Mists Interaction Log`.

### 3.2 Checking the Sky, Light, and Time

If players look up or try to judge time:

> You crane your neck to peer through the tangle of branches overhead. The sky is a **featureless blanket of dirty gray**, neither day nor night, as if the world has forgotten both.
> 
> No sun. No stars. No familiar constellations. Just a dim, directionless light that offers no warmth.

**If a player is a sailor, druid, ranger, or otherwise used to reading the sky:**
- Call for a **Wisdom (Survival) check** (DC 13).
  - **Success:**

> Everything about this sky is wrong. The light has no clear source. The shadows around you shift subtly, not in response to anything you can see, but like something is moving behind the clouds.

  - **Failure:**

> You squint and study the canopy and clouds, but there is nothing to read here—no familiar patterns, no trustworthy signs. It feels like staring at a painted ceiling.

**Prompt:**
- Ask: **"Does this change what you want to do next?"**

Log any player speculation or notable fear reactions; they can be reused later as Strahd-tailored taunts.

### 3.3 Examining the Road and Forest

If players inspect the road:

> The road is a scar of **mud and broken stone** pressed into the forest floor. Deep grooves mark where heavy wagons have passed, though none recently. Pools of cold water fill the ruts, reflecting the branches above like broken mirrors.

Tracks and signs (use as needed):
- **Wagon tracks** heading both directions (fresher toward the village side if you want to hint at civilization).
- **Boot prints** of varying sizes; some appear to simply **stop at the treeline**.
- Occasional **deep, clawed paw prints** (wolves, dire wolves) that come and go.

For detailed assessment, call for a **Wisdom (Survival) check**:
- **DC 10:** Basic road usage, wolves present.
- **DC 13:** Recent wagon passed within the last few days toward the village.
- **DC 15+:** Some boot prints end abruptly near patches of disturbed earth—signs of a struggle, with drag marks that vanish into the underbrush and then into the mists.

If players inspect the trees/forest edge:

> The trees stand too close together, trunks twisted as if they have slowly leaned toward the road over time. Many are bare, their bark slick with beads of moisture that look almost like sweat in the dim light.
> 
> Now and then, a drop of water falls from a branch and lands with a sound far too loud in the hush, like a single tick of a gigantic, unseen clock.

**Prompt:**
- **"Do you press along the road, or do you risk the forest?"**

For those entering the forest: refer to minor encounters in `04_Encounters/01_Mists_Arrival_Roadside_Encounters_Detailed.md` and update trackers accordingly.

## 4. Optional Mini-Encounters with Strahd (Distant Presence)

These scenes are designed to **foreshadow Strahd** without a direct, obvious confrontation. Use them as pacing tools; they can be skipped freely without harming the main plot.

### 4.1 Mini-Adventure: The Rider in the Mists *(Optional Strahd Cameo)*

**When to Trigger:**
- If players seem confident or dismissive of danger.
- If the party has moved along the road for 10–20 in-game minutes without incident.

**Setup:**
- Call for a **passive Perception** check against DC 13.
  - Any character whose passive meets or beats the DC notices the following without rolling.

**Narration – Distant Hoofbeats:**

> Somewhere far down the road, muffled by fog, you hear the **steady, hollow clop of hooves** on stone. The sound echoes strangely, as if the road itself were a tunnel.

If they wait or hide off the road:

> The hoofbeats grow louder, then slow. A **black horse** materializes from the mists, its coat slick and gleaming like oil. Its breath steams in long, slow exhalations. Upon its back sits a tall figure in a dark cloak, posture perfectly straight, gloved hands resting lightly on the reins.
> 
> You cannot see his face beneath the hood, but you can **feel** his gaze, weighing and measuring you from behind the veil of fog.

This **can be Strahd** or a lesser Barovian rider under his control, at your discretion.

- If this is Strahd, he should seem **utterly unthreatened**.

**Dialog Option A – Strahd Directly (Early, Subtle):**
- Voice: Smooth, faintly amused, with a hint of curiosity. Accent refined but not caricatured.

> "How curious," the figure says softly. "New faces, in an old and tired land. Tell me..." The head tilts slightly. "Do you know where you are?"

Possible player responses and DM guidance:
- **If they answer honestly ("No"):**

> A low chuckle. "Then you are already in more danger than you understand. Barovia is unkind to the lost." The rider's unseen eyes linger on each of you in turn. "Still... some are allowed to wander a while, before the land decides their fate. We shall see." 

- **If they bluff or posture:** Call for **Charisma (Deception or Intimidation)** opposed by Strahd's Insight.
  - On success: Strahd is amused, intrigued.
  - On failure: Strahd remains unimpressed but outwardly polite.

> "Bravery." The word is almost a compliment. "Or foolishness. Here, they are often the same thing. Walk carefully, little embers. This place loves nothing more than snuffing out the light." 

Strahd does **not** attack. He simply passes them, disappearing into the mists. Mark this as a **logged Strahd observation** in `06_Campaign_Trackers/01_Mists_And_Entry_Tracker.md`.

**Dialog Option B – Agent of Strahd (Safer for Low Levels):**
- A Barovian rider with a covered face and tight posture.

> The rider slows, glances at you briefly, then looks away as if afraid of what he sees.
> 
> "Turn back," he mutters, voice strained. "If you can. Before he notices you." He digs his heels into the horse's sides and vanishes into the fog.

This introduces the idea of **"he"** (Strahd) without direct exposure.

---

### 4.2 Mini-Adventure: The Laugh in the Trees *(Audio-Only Strahd)*

**Trigger:**
- Use when you want to remind players they are watched, especially after they make bold or mocking statements.

**Narration:**

> You push forward along the road, your footsteps dull and heavy. Then, out of nowhere, the forest goes still—**too** still. Even the distant wolves fall silent.
> 
> In that silence, you hear it: a **laugh**. Low. Rich. Amused. It seems to come from nowhere and everywhere at once, weaving between the branches and echoing inside your skull.
> 
> It lasts only a few seconds, then fades, swallowed by the mist.

If players call out or challenge the sound:

> Your words vanish into the trees. For a moment, you almost think you see **eyes**, far back between the trunks—two burning embers suspended in the dark. Then a cold gust of wind pulls the mist across your view, and they are gone.

**Mechanical Note:**
- Optionally call for a **Wisdom saving throw** (DC 12) against creeping dread.
  - On failure: a character has disadvantage on their next ability check in this scene due to shaken nerves.

Log notable reactions; Strahd may reference them later in Castle Ravenloft.

## 5. Player Interaction Beats & Prompts

Throughout this scene, regularly offer soft prompts and then **let silence do the work**. Example beats:

1. After initial boxed text: **"What do you do?"**
2. After any attempt to leave via the mists: **"That did not work. What now?"**
3. After inspecting tracks or signs of previous travelers: **"Do you follow these, or choose your own way?"**
4. After any Strahd-adjacent event (rider, laugh): **"How does that change your plan, if at all?"**

Use these to keep the players actively shaping their path while the world presses in around them.
