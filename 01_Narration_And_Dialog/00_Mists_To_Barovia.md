# The Mists Claim the Party

## Scene Flow
1. **The Mists Close In** — A gentle chill then choking fog surrounds the party. Vision drops to a few feet.
2. **Sounds of the Wild** — Distant wolves howl; ravens flap overhead unseen. Road becomes damp, muddy.
3. **Svalich Road** — Trees lean inward, branches skeletal. Roadside corpses on gallows creak in the wind.
4. **Gates of Barovia** — The iron gates appear, looming and half open. Mist billows beyond.
5. **Village Outskirts** — Smoke of cooking fires and the toll of a forlorn bell carry through the fog.

## Narration and Delivery
- **Tone:** Low, deliberate, mournful. Imagine breathing through clenched teeth.
- **Body Language:** Hunch forward, fold arms as if cold. Keep fingers twitching as though feeling damp air.
- **Pacing:** Speak slowly with lingering pauses; let players fill silence. Ask often: _"What do you do?"_

### Boxed-Style Opening (read or paraphrase)
> The air cools as a white curtain of mist coils around your boots. Pines close ranks, their tips clawing at a pewter sky. The road beneath you grows slick and rutted, and somewhere ahead a lonely bell tolls once before being swallowed by the fog. Shapes hang from a roadside gallows—some empty, one occupied by a cloth-wrapped form that turns in the wind. Ravens wheel above, cawing warnings that fade into distant wolf howls. The Mists press you onward.

### Player Prompts
- **Orientation:** “The fog muffles sound and hides distance. Stay on the road, or push into the trees?”
- **Investigation:** If they approach the gallows body, let it unravel to reveal a featureless corpse; touching it causes the form to crumble into sodden leaves.
- **Checks:** DC 13 Perception to notice raven tracks near the road; DC 14 Survival to realize something herded them here.
- **Branching:** Allow backtracking; the Mists thicken and gently push them forward with cold gusts. Fighting the fog leads to exhaustion-like cold damage after warnings.

### Common Actions and Responses
- **Light a torch:** Flame gutters, range is halved. Narrate oily smoke and sparks in the wet air.
- **Call out:** Voice echoes strangely; an unseen raven answers once, then silence.
- **Mark trees:** Marks stay but seem older within minutes, sapping confidence.

## Svalich Road Segment
### Details
- **Terrain:** Muddy track, leafless pines, occasional toppled milestone stones carved with claw marks.
- **Encounters:** Use one of the 04_Encounters/01_Road_Ambush.md setups when desired.
- **Foreshadowing:** Place black feathers and wagon ruts leading deeper into the valley; mention distant church bell.

### Dialogue Beats
- **Raven Messenger (non-verbal):** A raven hops near, caws sharply, then flies toward the gates. This foreshadows friendly avians (see 02_NPC_Dossiers/Raven_Scouts.md).
- **Disembodied Whisper:** “Turn back.” Deliver breathy and close to the mic; if players pursue, it fades.

## Gates of Barovia
- **Description:** Two 40-foot stone pillars topped with headless statues. Iron gates groan open when approached, close once all pass.
- **DM Actions:** Drag a finger along the table to mimic the gate swing; use creaking sounds.
- **Player Choice:** Climb pillars (DC 15 Athletics) to scout; push gates (heavy but yield with effort); camp (mist encroaches, cold).
- **Consequences:** Staying long draws a pack of wolves (see 03_Monsters/Dire_Wolf_Pack.md) or a Strahd observational flyby (see 13_Strahd_Encounters/Early_Sighting.md).

## Village Approach
- **Sensory Notes:** Wet wood smoke, rot of sodden leaves, distant sobbing carried on wind.
- **Opportunities:** Players can follow bell sound to the church, smoke to houses, or sobbing to **Mad Mary** (02_NPC_Dossiers/Mary_Hraska.md).
- **Branching:** Let them bypass the village by following river sounds toward the watermill; note consequences in 04_Encounters/02_Old_Bonegrinder_Road.md.
