# Area 00: The Mists – Arrival in Barovia

> Voice & Manner: **Deep, calm, and deliberate.** Speak slowly, as if the air itself is heavy. Let there be frequent pauses. Imagine you are half-narrator, half-malevolent storyteller who already knows how badly things will go.
>
> Physical Acting: Hunch slightly forward, draw your shoulders in as if cold. Occasionally exhale softly as though you can see your own breath. When mentioning the mists, let your eyes briefly drift to an empty corner of the room.

## 00.01 The First Hint of the Mists (Travel from the Prime World)

**Trigger:** The party is traveling on a road, in a forest, or in open country on their home world. Use this when the book indicates they are drawn into the Mists.

**Purpose:**
- Separate the characters from their home world.
- Foreshadow Barovia’s oppressive atmosphere.
- Give players time to talk, roleplay, and react to the growing unease.

### 00.01.A Opening Boxed Text – Encroaching Fog

Read or paraphrase slowly:

> The road stretches ahead in a long, familiar ribbon of dirt and stone. For a time, it is almost comforting—the steady rhythm of bootsteps, cart wheels, and clinking gear.
>
> Then, ever so gradually, the world begins to narrow.
>
> A low, silvery mist creeps along the ground at the edge of your vision, pooling in the ditches and coiling around the roots of trees. The air grows still. The ordinary sounds of the world—birds, insects, distant voices—fade, one by one, until all that remains is the muted scuff of your own steps.
>
> The scent of damp earth and wet leaves thickens, clinging to your lungs with every breath. Somewhere, far away, you think you hear the hollow call of a crow. Or was it a distant scream swallowed by the fog?
>
> Ahead, the road disappears into a curtain of pale gray.
>
> The mist does not rush you. It waits.

**Prompt the table (softly):**

> What do you do?

Pause. Let them talk, test the fog, argue, or prepare.

### 00.01.B Common Player Actions & DM Responses

**Action: The party stops and turns back.**  
- **Narration:**
  > You turn, retracing your steps. For a few minutes, the road feels the same beneath your feet, the same familiar bends and stones. But the world behind you has changed.
  >
  > The mist that once pooled at the sides now flows across the path you already walked. Trees stand like black silhouettes, their details smudged away by the gray. You walk faster. The mist thickens. You walk faster still… and the road bends in a way you do not remember, every step feel­ing less like escape and more like being gently turned.
  >
  > Within minutes, you can no longer tell whether you are going forward or back.
- **Mechanical Note:** No check will allow escape. Any Survival or Nature checks to navigate out of the Mists **fail by design**, but reward them with information:
  - **DC 12 Survival or Nature:** The direction of travel no longer matches your memories of the terrain.
  - **DC 15:** The fog seems **deliberate**, almost **reactive**, as if trying to keep you within it.

**Action: They try to wait it out / make camp.**  
- **Narration:**
  > Time becomes a strange and brittle thing in the fog. Minutes stretch thin. The sky is a flat, colorless white beyond the canopy. You cannot see the sun, but there is just enough light to deny you the comfort of night.
  >
  > The air never warms. The mist never thins. Your fire burns, but its light feels smothered, its warmth short-lived. Every shadow just beyond the glow looks like a figure standing perfectly still, watching.
- **Mechanical Consequences:**
  - Let them rest if needed, but note in your tracker that **the Mists will not clear**.  
  - Consider 1–2 eerie but non-lethal encounters (see cross-reference: `[04_Encounters/01_Mists_And_Journey/Encounter_001_Echoing_Footsteps.md]`).

**Action: They move cautiously into the Mists.**  
- **Narration (as they enter):**
  > The mist accepts you like water accepts a stone—silently, without resistance, and with the quiet promise that you will not emerge unchanged.
  >
  > The first step is just colder air around your boots. The second steals the warmth from your fingers. By the third, the world beyond ten paces is gone, swallowed whole. Your companions become shifting silhouettes, voices dampened as though spoken through a closed door.

**Action: They call out / use magic to probe (torches, light, detect magic, etc.).**
- **General Principle:** **Non-teleportation magic** does not break the Mists. Detection reveals a pervasive unnatural presence but no clear source.
- **Arcana / Religion / Nature Checks:**
  - **DC 10:** This is not ordinary weather. It is either magical or supernatural.
  - **DC 15:** The mist feels like a **boundary** or **barrier**, not an illusion. It is not trying to kill you—only to move you.
  - **DC 18+:** Anyone with planar or curse lore recognizes echoes of **cursed demiplanes** or **prison-realms** (Ravenloft flavor, no mechanics needed).

> If anyone casts **Detect Magic**: The fog **faintly radiates necromancy and enchantment**, but the aura is everywhere and effectively immeasurable.

## 00.02 Shaping the Journey – Time in the Mists

Use this section to stretch or compress travel depending on how much table time you want to spend in the Mists before Barovia.

**Tone:** The Mists should feel **inevitable, patient, and intelligent**, never rushed.

### 00.02.A Passing Time Montage

Pick 2–4 of these short vignettes to describe as they travel:

1. **The Vanishing World**  
   > For a few heartbeats, the fog thins, and you glimpse where you came from—trees you recognize, a split in the road, a half-buried milestone—floating like an island in a sea of gray. Then, with all the ceremony of a held breath released, the fog folds in and devours it. That last familiar landmark is gone.

2. **Footsteps Too Many**  
   > Your boots leave damp impressions on the road. Yet when you glance back, you see **more** footprints than there should be, crowded together in the mud. Some are your size. Some are smaller, some larger. Many are half-formed, as if whoever made them only half existed. With each blink, a few new prints appear, already softening at the edges, as though something invisible walks alongside you.

3. **Distant Carriage**  
   > Somewhere ahead—or is it behind?—you hear the faint rattle of wheels and the clop of hooves on stone. The sound never grows louder, never fades. It just circles you, like a predator deciding how hungry it is.
   >
   > For a single, unnerving moment, you smell **old leather, wet horsehair, and a trace of expensive, foreign perfume.**
   >
   > Then it’s gone. But the impression of someone watching remains.

4. **The Whispering Branches**  
   > Bare branches loom out of the mist, their shapes twisted and gnarled. As you pass, the windless air carries the faint sound of whispering leaves—except there are no leaves. The whispers have the cadence of speech but not the clarity. It is like overhearing a conversation in a language you almost understand, especially when it falls silent as soon as you focus on it.

5. **Weight on the Chest**  
   > Breathing feels like work. Each inhalation drags the chill deeper into your lungs, leaving a lingering ache. A dull pressure settles in your chest—not painful enough to stop you, but always present, like the sense of being watched when you are certain you are alone.

After each vignette, look at the players and offer:

> The fog thickens and the road carries you on. What do you do?


### 00.02.B Optional Checks – Resisting Despair

To emphasize the oppressive nature of the Mists without punishing players:

- Ask for a **group Wisdom saving throw, DC 10–12**.
- **On success:**
  > The strangeness gnaws at you, but you steel yourself. This is not the first danger you have faced. As long as you keep moving, you will not be swallowed by fear.
- **On failure:**
  > For a moment, the fog feels closer, like a hand pressed over your mouth. You shake it off, but a whisper of doubt lingers: *What if you never find the edge of this?*

No mechanical penalties; just roleplay prompts. If a player leans into fear, reward with **Inspiration**.

## 00.03 First Brush with Strahd’s Attention (Foreshadowing)

This is not a full encounter with Strahd, but a **brush with his notice**. Use it once during the Mists, or skip it if you prefer a slower reveal. This moment should hint that **something intelligent owns this domain**.

### 00.03.A The Watching Presence

**Trigger:** After 10–20 minutes (in-game) of travel through the Mists, or once the players begin asking who/what is doing this.

**Narration:**

> The fog around you stills.
>
> Not all at once, but like a crowd falling silent the moment a king steps onto a balcony.
>
> The ever-present soft hiss of shifting vapor fades. For the first time since you entered the Mists, you hear your own heartbeat. Your next breath frosts faintly in the air, though the temperature has not changed.
>
> And then, from somewhere in the gray—a direction you cannot name—you feel it.
>
> A gaze.
>
> Not the wild, hungry stare of a beast, but the cool appraisal of someone seated on a distant throne, watching you as if you were pieces on a board.

Pause. Let them react.

**If the players call out, challenge, or threaten the unseen watcher:**

> Your words are swallowed by the Mists. For a heartbeat, you think there is no answer. Then a low chuckle rides the air—soft, cultured, and utterly amused.
>
> It sounds very close. Right beside your ear. And yet, when you turn, there is no one there.

**Strahd’s Disembodied Voice (optional early use):**  
Use a smooth, aristocratic voice with a faint Eastern European lilt.

> "So eager," the voice murmurs, **rich with dark amusement**. "And so far from home. Walk on, little wanderers. The road you seek has only one destination."
>
> The laughter fades, but the sense of being watched lingers, like a hand that has not quite lifted from your shoulder.

Mechanically, this has no effect. It is pure mood and foreshadowing.

## 00.04 Exiting the Mists – The Gates of Barovia

When you are ready to transition to Barovia proper, move to the scene where the road emerges from the Mists near the great iron gates.

### 00.04.A Transition Boxed Text

> The damp air clings to you, heavy and indifferent, as you press on. The fog thickens around your legs and rises to your chest, your shoulders, your throat, until every breath feels drawn through wet cloth.
>
> Then, step by reluctant step, the gray begins to pale.
>
> Shapes emerge—first the ghost of a tree branch overhead, then the coarse outline of stone at your feet. The air opens just enough to suggest space beyond your arm’s reach. The world is no longer only fog.
>
> The road here is slick and dark, flanked by looming pines whose needles glisten with beads of moisture. Above, the sky is a colorless shroud of low clouds, offering no hint of sun or stars.
>
> Ahead, two colossal shapes loom out of the thinning Mists: the **gates of Barovia**, wrought iron and ancient stone, standing like the jaws of some sleeping titan.

## 00.05 Mini-Adventures in the Mists (Retracking Tools)

Use these short scenes if players try to escape, wander aimlessly, or if you need time to adjust pacing. Each is designed to gently **herd them toward Barovia** while offering roleplay and tension.

### 00.05.A MINI-ADVENTURE: The Lost Patrol

**Tag:** `[RETRACKING MINI-ADVENTURE]`

**Concept:** The party encounters a spectral or illusory patrol of soldiers from a bygone war who endlessly march through the Mists. Interacting with them creates an eerie roleplay scene that always ends with the party back on the Barovian road.

- **Encounter File Cross-Reference:** `[04_Encounters/01_Mists_And_Journey/Encounter_010_The_Lost_Patrol.md]`.
- **NPC Dossiers:** `[02_NPC_Dossiers/Mists/Commander_Vladin_Spectral_Patrol.md]`.

**Narration Hook:**

> Shapes move ahead—several figures in armor, marching in formation with the hollow discipline of habit long calcified into obsession. Their armor is outdated by at least a century, pitted and scarred. They carry no banners.
>
> As they draw near, you realize their faces are pale and unfocused, as if drawn from memory rather than flesh.

**Player Interaction:**
- They may hail, threaten, or join the march.
- **Insight DC 12:** These soldiers are not fully aware of the present.
- **Religion/Arcana DC 13:** They are likely spirits or echoes bound to the Mists.

**Retracking Outcome:** No matter what, when the scene ends and visibility shifts, the party finds themselves **back on the main Barovian road** near the gates.


### 00.05.B MINI-ADVENTURE: The Empty Village

**Tag:** `[RETRACKING MINI-ADVENTURE]`

**Concept:** The Mists briefly reveal a small, half-real village that the party can explore. Its houses are hollow shells, filled with flickering memories. Doors and streets subtly guide the party along a path that eventually folds back into the Barovian road.

- **Encounter File Cross-Reference:** `[04_Encounters/01_Mists_And_Journey/Encounter_020_The_Empty_Village.md]`.

**Narration Hook:**

> The fog parts just enough to reveal rooftops—crooked, sagging, and wet with condensation. A village, small and cramped, appears around you as if it has grown out of the Mists themselves.
>
> Doors hang crookedly on rusted hinges. Windows gape, their glass long gone, their frames beaded with moisture. There are no lights, no voices, no smoke from any chimney. Yet you can’t shake the feeling this place remembers being alive.

**Player Interaction:**
- Investigate houses; each holds a **memory echo** (non-combat scenes, unsettling glimpses of Barovian life).  
- Use to foreshadow Barovia’s despair: arguing couples, hungry children, a priest praying to a silent god (all as faded illusions).

**Retracking Outcome:** As they leave the village, all roads and paths coalesce into one: the wet, dark road leading to the gates of Barovia.


### 00.05.C MINI-ADVENTURE: The Rider in the Fog (Strahd’s First Game)

**Tag:** `[RETRACKING MINI-ADVENTURE]` and `[MINI STRAHD ENCOUNTER]`

**Concept:** A distant rider appears in the Mists, circling, observing. This may or may not be Strahd himself (you decide per session). It offers a strong roleplay moment, a sense of being hunted, and a clean way to end with the party on the intended path.

- **Encounter File Cross-Reference:** `[04_Encounters/01_Mists_And_Journey/Encounter_030_The_Rider_In_The_Fog.md]`.
- **Strahd NPC Dossier:** `[02_NPC_Dossiers/Barovia_Castle/Strahd_von_Zarovich.md]`.

**Narration Hook:**

> A dark shape moves through the fog—a horse, tall and unsettlingly silent, its hooves making almost no sound as they meet the damp earth. The rider sits straight-backed in the saddle, cloaked in black, his features obscured by the hood and by the roiling Mists.
>
> He keeps his distance, always just far enough away that you cannot see his face clearly. Yet wherever you turn, he is already there, as if the road itself is folding to keep him in front of you.

**If the players hail him:**
- In a smooth, measured voice (if you decide it is Strahd):
  > "You have come far," the rider says, his words heavy with an unfamiliar accent. "Few reach this road by accident, and fewer still leave it. Tell me, travelers… what do you hope to find at the end of this fog?"
- Encourage roleplay. Strahd responds with amused detachment, never offering his name.

**If the players attack:**
- The rider and horse dissolve into blowing strands of fog with the first solid hit.
- **Arcana/Religion DC 14:** This was either an illusion or a projection of a powerful will.

**Retracking Outcome:** After the scene, the Mists surge, the path narrows, and when visibility returns the party stands near the gates of Barovia.
