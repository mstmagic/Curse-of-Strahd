# Narration & Dialog – Overview

This folder contains ready‑to‑read scripts and cues for a new or anxious DM. Everything is organized in the same rough order the party experiences Barovia, starting the moment the mists take them.

Each scene file follows this pattern:
- **Voice & Acting Notes** – How to sound and behave.
- **Opening Read‑Aloud** – Boxed text you can literally read.
- **Beat Map** – Key moments to pause and ask, "What do you do?"
- **Player Action Responses** – Common questions and actions, with suggested DCs.
- **Roleplay Hooks** – Ways to involve extra NPCs and scenery.
- **Strahd Options** – Optional or required moments where Strahd appears or leaves a mark.

Subfolders are organized by region and then by specific location / micro‑scene.

Current coverage: from the mists taking the characters up to and including first exploration in the Village of Barovia.
