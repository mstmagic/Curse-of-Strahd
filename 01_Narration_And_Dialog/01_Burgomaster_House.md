# Burgomaster's House Arrival

## Scene Flow
1. **Approach:** House is barricaded; lantern light flickers. Door reinforced with plank.
2. **Knock or Call:** Ismark answers cautiously; Ireena waits behind with drawn blade.
3. **Inside:** Sparse warmth, lingering incense; body of Kolyan on a table under linens.
4. **Ask for Aid:** Ismark petitions the party; Ireena gauges them.
5. **Decision:** Escort request, funeral plan, or staying to defend.

## Tone and Delivery
- **Mood:** Claustrophobic safety barely holding. Speak with hushed urgency.
- **Body Language:** Keep shoulders tense; pace slowly across room to mimic Ismark’s restless energy.
- **Prompting:** After each exchange ask, “What do you do?”

## Opening Read-Aloud
> Shuttered windows flicker with amber light. Boards and torn curtains are nailed over cracks, and the smell of incense tries—and fails—to mask a cloying sweetness. A weary man peers through a chain, sweat on his brow. “If you are not wolves or shadows, speak now.”

## Player Options
- **Earn Trust:** Show holy symbols, medical supplies, or news from outside. Persuasion DC 12.
- **Breach:** Forcing entry triggers Ireena’s challenge and potential combat.
- **Offer Aid:** Agreeing to guard the night grants a short rest and rumor sharing.

## Dialogue Prompts
- **Ismark:** “My father is dead. My sister is hunted. I have coin and courage, but not enough blades.”
- **Ireena (measured):** “Swear you will not deliver me to the devil and I will ride with you.”
- **Questions PCs Ask:**
  - **“What killed your father?”** → “Fear and strain. Strahd’s beasts battered our walls until his heart failed.”
  - **“Where can we take you?”** → “The church still holds consecration. Beyond that, maybe Vallaki.”
  - **“Why us?”** → “Because you walked the road and returned. That is more than any neighbor.”

## Consequences & Branches
- **Accept Escort:** Leads to funeral skill challenge and journey (prep 04_Encounters/03_Burgomaster_Siege.md).
- **Refuse:** Strahd may gloat later; villagers resent outsider apathy.
- **Stay Overnight:** Night attack chance; roll on 05_Lookup_Tables/Village_Rumors.md for midnight whispers.
