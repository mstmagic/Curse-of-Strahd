Overview

This folder contains narration scripts and DM dialog queues that begin at the moment the player characters are whisked away by the mists and arrive in Barovia. Files are organized chronologically and by area; each file begins with voice/acting cues, followed by narrated text, NPC dialog scripts, optional player prompts, likely player actions and recommended DM responses, and cross-references to NPC dossiers, encounters, and monsters.

Use: open the file that matches the map tile or location the party is at and read the short voice cue then the narration. The scripts aim to be performance-ready for new DMs and provide multiple branching lines to handle common player choices.
