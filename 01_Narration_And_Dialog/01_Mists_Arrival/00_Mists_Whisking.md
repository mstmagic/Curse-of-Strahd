Voice/Acting Cue: Speak slowly; low, distant tone. Imagine recounting a half-remembered dream. Slight reverb if your setup allows.

Narration — Arrival in Barovia

You feel the air thicken as the world around you slips. A scent — wet earth and iron — fills your nostrils. The scenery you know fragments: a roadside, a wagon’s wheel, the last visible face of a companion — and then the mist swallows them. It is as if someone cut the world along a seam and folded it inward, the edges soft and cold.

Light drains like breath from a candle; sounds compress into small, bright points that pop and die. When the mist finally parts, you stand on a lonely road. A sky like old pewter hangs above. Far off, jagged against that sky, a castle crouches atop a crag, spires like grasping fingers. The land around you is a patchwork of swamp and fence, thin trees whose branches claw at the gray.

A raven lands on a nearby signpost. It watches you with an intelligence that makes your skin prickle.

DM Prompts / Actions to Take:
- Show the map of Barovia (open map tokens to the "starting road"). Pause for player reactions.
- If a player asks "Where are we?" read: "The road beneath your boots is old, and the air tastes of iron and rain you cannot see. No landmarks remain you recognize. Ahead, the village of Barovia nestles like a wound in the valley. Beyond, Castle Ravenloft watches."
- If players attempt to recall how they arrived, ask for a Wisdom (History) or Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 12). Provide a vague memory: "a swirling of mists, the smell of the road, a feeling of being small and wrong."

Likely Player Actions / Recommended DM Responses:
- Search for tracks: Allow a Perception check (DC 13) to find damp, muddied footprints leading toward the village; they are not fresh — old and half-obliterated.
- Call out to townsfolk: none answer; the village feels watched. A soft Echo: occasionally a distant bell, or the rumble of hoofs on far stones.
- Explore the road: a rusted sign points the way to "Barovia — 2 miles". A shallow ditch beside the road collects water that moves in slow, deliberate eddies.

Optional Hooks/Mini-Encounters (marked as optional):
- Optional: The Broken Wagon (CR 1/2)
  - Scene: A smashed wagon sits half in the ditch. Personal effects scatter — a locket, a torn child’s doll, a farmers ledger. A single, splintered box contains a wet letter hinting at a missing family.
  - Purpose: Introduce local fear and set the tone. Provide small treasure and a rumor about Strahd’s toll on travelers.

- Optional: The Mist-Cloaked Rider (CR 3)
  - Scene: A figure on horseback appears far along the road, armoured and blank-helmed; the horse’s breath fogs, though the rider is unnaturally still. If engaged, the rider is cruelly polite and vanishes into the mists if outmatched.
  - Purpose: Tease Strahd's influence. Provide a combat or a roleplay/stealth option.
