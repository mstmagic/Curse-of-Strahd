Title: Transcription Plan — "Curse of Strahd Handouts"

Source PDF: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstmagic/Curse-of-Strahd/main/SourceMaterial/Curse%20of%20Strahd%20Handouts.pdf

Status: In progress — initial structure created.

Objective and workflow: Same as for the main book. Handouts will be treated as individual documents; each handout will receive its own markdown file and any images will be saved under assets/.

Naming convention: 01_Handout_Title.md, assets/, README.md index.

Next steps:
- Extract individual handouts, create one markdown file per handout.
- Extract images and format handouts for print and in-line display.
