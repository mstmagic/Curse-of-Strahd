# Curse of Strahd Book — Transcription Readme

Source PDF: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstmagic/Curse-of-Strahd/main/SourceMaterial/Curse%20of%20Strahd%20Book.pdf

Purpose

- Create a high-quality Markdown transcription of the PDF.
- Break content into sequential chapter files named with an ordered prefix (01_..., 02_..., etc.).

Planned structure

- 01_Chapter_01_Introduction.md
- 02_Chapter_02_...md
- ...

Transcription approach

1. Perform OCR on the PDF (page ranges will be recorded per chapter).
2. Clean OCR output: fix hyphenation, headers/footers, page numbers, and formatting errors.
3. Convert content into Markdown using semantic headings, lists, tables, and code blocks where appropriate.
4. Preserve important art/figures as image references when necessary (images saved under ./images/).

Current status

- Placeholders created for the book directory and chapter 01.
- Actual OCR/transcription work is in progress. Chapter files will be populated incrementally with high-fidelity Markdown content.

Notes

- Maintain original pagination references at the top of each chapter file.
- Any sensitive or copyrighted material will be flagged per repository policy.
