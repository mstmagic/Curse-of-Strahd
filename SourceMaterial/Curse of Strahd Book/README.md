- Preserve headings, sections, stat blocks, tables, and handout content as closely as possible.
- Create incremental commits as chapters are completed.

Placeholders created:
- Chapters/01_Chapter_01.md — will cover pages 1-30 (initial transcription placeholder)
- Chapters/02_Chapter_02.md — will cover pages 31-60 (initial transcription placeholder)

Notes:
- This README links to the original PDF in SourceMaterial for reference.
- Update this file as transcription progresses with accurate page ranges and completion status.
