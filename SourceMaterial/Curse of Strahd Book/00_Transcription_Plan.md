Transcription Plan for "Curse of Strahd Book" PDF

Status: Placeholder files created. Original PDF: SourceMaterial/"Curse of Strahd Book.pdf" (binary present in repo).

Goal
- Produce a high-quality Markdown transcription of the PDF broken into chapters and sections, preserving headings, tables, stat blocks, and handouts where possible.

Immediate actions taken
- Created this transcription plan and placeholder chapter files to begin organizing the resulting material.

Planned workflow
1. OCR and extract text from the PDF (preserve layout where relevant).
2. Split extracted text into logical chapters and sections based on original headings.
3. Create a numbered Markdown file for each chapter (e.g., 01_Chapter_01.md, 02_Chapter_02.md).
4. Where the PDF contains images, maps, or tables, add a note and export images into the folder (images/) and reference them in the Markdown.
5. For stat blocks or boxed content, use fenced code blocks or tables to preserve formatting.
6. Proofread and clean up formatting: correct OCR errors, restore punctuation, ensure consistent heading hierarchy.
7. Commit changes incrementally and record progress in Agent.md.

Placeholders
- 01_Chapter_01.md — Placeholder for Chapter 1 content. Replace with transcription once OCR/extraction is complete.

Notes
- OCR/transcription must be performed with an external tool (not executed within this commit). This file documents the plan and status.
