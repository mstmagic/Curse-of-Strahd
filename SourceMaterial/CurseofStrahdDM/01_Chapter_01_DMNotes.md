# Chapter 1 — DM Notes (Placeholder)

Source: CurseofStrahdDM.pdf — pages TBD

**Transcription status**: Initial placeholder. Will transcribe DM notes from chapter 1, including:

- Encounter descriptions and triggers
- NPC motivations and secret knowledge blocks (clearly labeled as DM-only)
- Map references and image attachments
- Stat blocks converted into Markdown code fences and standardized stat-block formatting

(Actual content to be populated after OCR pass and cleanup.)
