# DM Quickstart — Barovia Entry Arc

- **Core Themes:** Isolation, broken faith, watching eyes, choice with cost.
- **Player Agency:** Always provide at least three meaningful options (aid villagers, pursue Strahd signs, chase rumors).
- **Safety & Tone:** Check comfort levels; horror through tension not gore. Use fading lights and quiet speech.
- **Recurring Beats:** Wolf howls, raven guides, church bell, whispers in the Mist.
