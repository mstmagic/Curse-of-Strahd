# Agent Log – 2025-11-28

## What I did this session
- Enumerated the repository root to understand existing structure.
- Detected absence of an `Agents/` directory and per-instructions began creating agent-specific note files.
- Created the following Markdown notes in `Agents/`:
  - `Master_Dungeon_Master.md` – for lore, pacing, and narrative-structure feedback.
  - `New_Dungeon_Master.md` – for usability and clarity feedback from a novice DM perspective.
  - `Player.md` – to capture fun, agency, and emotional-impact notes.
  - `Editor_and_Publisher.md` – for structure, formatting, and completeness concerns.

## Criticisms / Concerns
- Current work has only set up the feedback infrastructure; the main campaign-expansion folders (01–06) have not yet been created.
- No actual Curse of Strahd content has been expanded yet; this will need substantial multi-session work to approach the “100x source” ambition.

## Next Steps
- Create the high-level folder tree at repo root:
  - `01_Narration_And_Dialog/`
  - `02_NPC_Dossiers/`
  - `03_Monsters/`
  - `04_Encounters/`
  - `05_Lookup_Tables/`
  - `06_Campaign_Trackers/`
- Within `01_Narration_And_Dialog/`, begin with the chapter covering the mists whisking the party into Barovia (the transition from the Material Plane into the Svalich Woods and Village of Barovia), building:
  - Area-based subfolders (Road, Gates, Svalich Woods, Village perimeter, key buildings).
  - Highly scripted narration and dialogue queues for each “pin” on the map.
- Start populating `02_NPC_Dossiers/` with core early-campaign NPCs (Ismark, Ireena, Kolyan, common Barovians, and a few original townsfolk for richer role play).
- After an initial slice of narration + NPC dossiers exists, design the first wave of Strahd micro-encounters and soft cameos.
