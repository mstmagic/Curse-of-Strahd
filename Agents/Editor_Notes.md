# Editor & Publisher Notes

## Session: Mists Arrival & Initial Structure Review

### 1. Repository & Structure
- Verified root folders exist: `01_Narration_And_Dialog/`, `02_NPC_Dossiers/`, `03_Monsters/`, `04_Encounters/`, `05_Lookup_Tables/`, `06_Campaign_Trackers/`, `SourceMaterial/`, and `Agents/`.
- Confirmed that each major documentation pillar already has an initial index/readme-style file, which is helpful for navigation and scaling:
  - `01_Narration_And_Dialog/00_Overview.md`
  - `02_NPC_Dossiers/000_Global_NPC_Index.md` & `README.md`
  - `03_Monsters/000_Global_Monster_Index.md` & `README.md`
  - `04_Encounters/000_Global_Encounter_Index.md` & `README.md`
  - `05_Lookup_Tables/000_Lookup_Tables_Index.md` & `README.md`
  - `06_Campaign_Trackers/000_Campaign_Tracker_Index.md` & `README.md`

### 2. Agent Notes Reviewed
- `MasterDM_Notes.md` – checked for any requirements on lore accuracy and faithfulness to Curse of Strahd; will continue to enforce fidelity to official tone, themes, and mechanical expectations.
- `NewDM_Notes.md` – reinforces need for high navigability, explicit DM guidance, and lots of scaffolding for roleplay and choices. Current structure (area-based subfolders, indices, and trackers) supports this; future additions must keep explicit "how to run this moment" language.
- `Player_Notes.md` – emphasizes fun, agency, and plentiful interaction hooks. I will require that narration and encounters include clear decision points and example player actions with likely NPC/world responses.
- `Editor_Notes.md` (this file) – updated to log this pass and the expectations I will enforce going forward.

### 3. Accuracy & Style Standards to Enforce
- Lore accuracy: remain aligned with core Curse of Strahd canon (Barovia, Strahd, themes of horror and despair, etc.). Any new material must feel diegetic and not contradict established canon. Where something is homebrew, it must be clearly labeled as such.
- Tone: keep descriptions dark, oppressive, and atmospheric while allowing brief, intentional moments of levity or warmth only as contrast.
- New content volume: ensure that expansions are very detailed, with extra narration, side characters, and optional encounters, but avoid bloated or repetitive prose that would be hard for a DM to use at the table.
- DM usability: each narration/scene file must read like a script and playbook: include opening voice/acting notes, boxed-text style narration, explicit DM prompts (e.g., **DM Prompt: "What do you do?"**), and bullet-point responses for common player actions.
- Cross-references: when another file or subsystem is mentioned (e.g., a monster, NPC, encounter, table, or tracker), always include the explicit file path so a DM can quickly open it.

### 4. Compliance With User Instructions
- Confirmed that the Writer has started laying the foundation in all required folders but content is still in early stages.
- I will require that future Writer contributions:
  - Expand `01_Narration_And_Dialog/` from the “whisked away by the mists” point forward, organized by area, with nested folders and highly detailed scripts.
  - Populate `02_NPC_Dossiers/` with comprehensive NPC entries (attributes, demographics, knowledge/ignorance, motivations, secrets, checks required, combat stat blocks).
  - Populate `03_Monsters/` with monster stat blocks tailored to Curse of Strahd (and any new Barovian creatures), cross-referenced by encounters.
  - Populate `04_Encounters/` with exact tactical layouts, including monster placement, terrain notes, and links to monsters, NPCs, and relevant lookup tables.
  - Grow `05_Lookup_Tables/` into a robust toolbox (random atmospheric details, travel complications, Strahd appearances, Barovian names, etc.).
  - Expand `06_Campaign_Trackers/` to track NPC relationships, Strahd’s awareness and interest, time of day, weather, and regional changes.

### 5. Next Editorial Focus
- On the next pass, I will:
  - Review newly added narration files in `01_Narration_And_Dialog/01_Mists`, `01_Mists_And_Journey`, and `01_Mists_Arrival` to ensure they function as usable scripts (voice notes, prompts, branches).
  - Check that any new NPCs and monsters are mirrored in the appropriate indices and cross-referenced correctly.
  - Enforce consistent file naming conventions for chronological and geographical clarity.

*These notes reflect the current editorial state and expectations for future Writer output.*
