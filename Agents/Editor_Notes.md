# Editor & Publisher Notes

*(Existing content preserved; this section records new structural and editorial choices.)*

## Mists & Entry Documentation Update

- Added a new narration file at `01_Narration_And_Dialog/01_Mists_And_Entry/02_First_Steps_Into_Barovia.md` with:
  - Strict hierarchical headings.
  - Clear voice/acting notes.
  - Boxed text and explicit player prompts.
  - Cross-references to encounters, lookup tables, and trackers.
- Expanded `02_NPC_Dossiers/Strahd_von_Zarovich.md` into a full dossier emphasizing personality, motivations, and usage notes for new DMs.
- Enhanced `05_Lookup_Tables/Mists_Arrival_Lookups.md` with actionable tables for checks, emotional prompts, and non-combat oddities.
- Updated `06_Campaign_Trackers/01_Mists_And_Entry_Tracker.md` for better logging of mists interactions, travel segments, and Strahd awareness.
- Updated all relevant `Agents/*.md` files to reflect these additions and how they should be used.

### Editorial Notes
- Cross-references now consistently include **full repository paths** for quick navigation.
- Future work should continue this pattern for each major region (village of Barovia, Death House, Old Svalich Road segments, Vallaki, etc.) to maintain coherence.
