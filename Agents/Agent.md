Agent Log - Progress and Actions

Overview
- Repository inspected: confirmed SourceMaterial folder contains official PDFs (Curse of Strahd Book.pdf, Handouts, DM and Player PDFs).
- Began work to create campaign expansion material: narration, NPC dossiers, monsters, encounters, lookup tables, campaign trackers.

Work performed (chronological):
1) Inspected repository root and SourceMaterial to confirm source files exist.
2) Created Agents/Agent.md to track progress (this file).
3) Created Agents review placeholder files for Master DM, New DM, Player, Editor to collect feedback.
4) Created primary folders and initial content files under:
   - 01_Narration_And_Dialog/Village_of_Barovia/
   - 02_NPC_Dossiers/
   - 03_Monsters/
   - 04_Encounters/
   - 05_Lookup_Tables/
   - 06_Campaign_Trackers/
5) Wrote detailed starting-scene narration ("Mists Arrival") following the moment PCs are whisked away by the mists. Included voice acting cues, step-by-step recitation, prompts, likely player actions, and recommended GM responses.
6) Created multiple NPC dossiers (Ismark, Ireena, Strahd) with demographics, appearance, motivations, complete knowledge lists, willingness/unwillingness to share, and suggested persuasion/skill DCs. Included a simple combat stat summary for quick reference.
7) Created monster summaries with combat tactics and simplified stat blocks (Vampire Spawn, Wolves) appropriate for use in encounters.
8) Designed an initial encounter (Barovian Wagon Ambush) with map placement suggestions, initiative flow, enemy tactics, loot, and follow-up narration hooks.
9) Wrote lookup tables for weather/ambience and random Barovian rumors to provide on-the-fly content and atmosphere.
10) Created campaign tracker templates: quest log, NPC relationships, and session notes placeholders.

Next steps (recommended):
- Review created files and provide feedback in Agents/*.md review files.
- Expand each folder with additional areas, NPCs, and encounter variants (many more files to reach the "massive" repository target).
- Add full mechanical stat blocks under 03_Monsters for all monsters in the source material and new monsters introduced.
- Add cross-reference links to exact page numbers in SourceMaterial PDFs (requires manual mapping).

Status: Initial content created and committed. Awaiting reviewer notes (files created under Agents/).
