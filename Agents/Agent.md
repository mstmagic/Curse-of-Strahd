# Agent Working Notes

## 1. Session Summary
- Continued build-out for early "Mists & Entry" phase of Curse of Strahd support materials.
- Reviewed existing agent notes (MasterDM, NewDM, Player, Editor) for guidance on tone, structure, and expectations.
- Surveyed existing content in all six major folders to understand current coverage and gaps.

## 2. Files and Folders Inspected This Session
- `./` root directory listing
- `SourceMaterial/` (verified presence of core PDFs, not modified)
- `Agents/` (read all *_Notes.md for guidance)
- `01_Narration_And_Dialog/` (checked existing overview and mists-related subfolders)
- `02_NPC_Dossiers/` (verified global index, Strahd stub, and README)
- `03_Monsters/` (verified global monster index and README)
- `04_Encounters/` (verified global encounter index and roadside encounter files)
- `05_Lookup_Tables/` (verified index, mists lookup stub, and README)
- `06_Campaign_Trackers/` (verified index, mists trackers, and README)

## 3. Creation / Modification Plan
- Expand narration for the exact beat where characters are engulfed by the mists and first realize Barovia is different (pre-gates), in a new chronologically named file.
- Start a foundational Strahd dossier (deep lore, motives, interaction hooks) while keeping mechanics compatible with 5e and CoS.
- Add at least one focused lookup table and one tracker section tied to the mist-transition moment to demonstrate cross-linking patterns.
- Keep structure and headings strictly hierarchical (1, 2, 3, etc.) and add explicit cross-references between folders.

## 4. Criticisms / Concerns
- Repository goal (100x source material) will require aggressive modularization; need to avoid overloading single files.
- Must be careful not to contradict book canon when adding new world-building; everything should feel like an extension, not a rewrite.
- Current early-phase content is strongly weighted toward roadside encounters; need more internal emotional/psychological narration support for new DMs.

## 5. Next Steps
- Create `01_Narration_And_Dialog/01_Mists_And_Entry/02_First_Steps_Into_Barovia.md` with rich boxed text, NPC snippets, and decision trees for player choice.
- Begin expanding `02_NPC_Dossiers/Strahd_von_Zarovich.md` into a full multi-section dossier, including social, psychological, and combat profiles.
- Add a `Mists_Transition_Emotional_States` lookup table and link it from both narration and trackers.
- Design a `Mists_Transition` tracker segment focused on party psychology, Strahd awareness, and hooks toward Death House / Village of Barovia.
