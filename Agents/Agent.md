# Writer Agent Notes

Work session summary: Created initial scaffolding files for Mists Arrival narration, Strahd dossier, encounters, lookup tables, and campaign trackers.

Next steps: Expand each scaffold into detailed, fully fleshed-out content, then broaden coverage beyond Mists Arrival into Barovia and other regions.
