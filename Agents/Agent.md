# Agent – Writer

## 1. Role

You are the **Writer** for the Curse of Strahd expansion project. Your tasks:

1. Explode the original Curse of Strahd material into a far more detailed, roleplay‑rich reference set.
2. Keep everything organized into these top‑level folders:
   - `/01_Narration_And_Dialog/`
   - `/02_NPC_Dossiers/`
   - `/03_Monsters/`
   - `/04_Encounters/`
   - `/05_Lookup_Tables/`
   - `/06_Campaign_Trackers/`
3. Always respect the tone and lore of Curse of Strahd: bleak, oppressive, tragic Gothic horror.
4. Provide cross‑references between files so a DM can quickly jump between narration, NPCs, monsters, encounters, tables, and trackers.

## 2. Recent Work Log

### 2.1 Current Session

- Reviewed existing agent and reviewer notes in `/Agents/*`.
- Verified repository structure and presence of `/SourceMaterial` PDFs.
- Created initial structure for the **Mists and Entry** phase starting from when the mists whisk the players away.
- Added:
  - `/01_Narration_And_Dialog/01_Mists_And_Entry/Area_Overview.md` – high‑level design for the entry arc, themes, structure, and Strahd touchpoints.
  - `/01_Narration_And_Dialog/01_Mists_And_Entry/01_Mists_Close_In.md` – detailed, step‑by‑step guided narration for the first appearance of the mists, with player prompts and optional early Strahd glimpse.
  - `/06_Campaign_Trackers/01_Mists_And_Entry_Tracker.md` – tracker template for this whole arc (hooks, events, Strahd interactions, conditions, mini‑adventures).
- Ensured cross‑references point to planned future files (to be filled in upcoming passes) for encounters and lookup tables.

## 3. Self‑Critique

- The current content focuses only on the **very earliest** segment of the campaign (entry via the mists). The overall project goal is to expand content to ~100x the base material; this will require many additional passes and a systematic sweep through every area of Barovia.
- Several referenced files (e.g., atmospheric tables, detailed encounters, bestiary index, NPC indices) are not yet created and must be added soon to avoid dead links.
- Strahd’s presence is sketched but not yet fully developed with multiple scalable encounter scripts and mini‑adventures in this phase.

## 4. Next Steps

1. **Narration & Dialog Expansion**
   - Create `/01_Narration_And_Dialog/01_Mists_And_Entry/02_Road_Through_The_Mists.md` and subsequent scene files up to the village outskirts.
   - Add `Mini_Adventures_Index.md` and at least 2–3 short re‑tracking mini‑adventures suitable for this phase.
2. **Encounters & Monsters**
   - Begin `/04_Encounters/01_Mists_And_Entry/` with detailed write‑ups for:
     - `Strahd_Rider_On_The_Ridge.md`
     - `Strahd_Observation_Encounters.md`
     - Early wolf pack probes.
   - Start `/03_Monsters/Bestiary_Index.md` and add Barovian wolves and dire wolves as first entries.
3. **Lookup Tables**
   - Create `/05_Lookup_Tables/01_Mists_And_Entry/Atmospheric_Dressing_Table.md` and `Mist_Effects_Table.md` to support the narration already written.
4. **NPC Dossiers**
   - Plan structure of `/02_NPC_Dossiers/` by region (Village of Barovia, Vistani, etc.), even if detailed population comes later.

These steps will build a strong, reusable foundation for the early‑campaign experience before moving deeper into Barovia’s locations and factions.
