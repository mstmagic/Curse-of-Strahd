# Agent Notes

## Current Focus
- Begin building out Curse of Strahd support materials starting from the moment the characters are drawn into the mists
- Establish initial folder and file structure for narration, NPC dossiers, monsters, encounters, lookup tables, and campaign trackers

## Session Log
- Reviewed existing repository layout and confirmed presence of `SourceMaterial` PDFs

- Created initial index files for narration/dialog, NPCs, monsters, encounters, lookup tables, and campaign trackers
- Built detailed Area 00: The Mists narration file with:
  - Boxed text for entering and traveling through the Mists
  - Common player actions with suggested DM responses and light mechanics
  - Foreshadowing of Strahd via disembodied presence and optional rider
  - Three retracking mini-adventures to funnel players back toward Barovia while adding roleplay and tension
