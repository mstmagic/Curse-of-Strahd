# Agent Notes - Writer

## Session Summary
- Began build-out of exhaustive DM support materials for Curse of Strahd, starting at the point where the characters are overtaken by the mists.
- Reviewed existing agent notes for Master DM, New DM, Player, and Editor to ensure style consistency and requirements.
- Confirmed existing top-level folders and verified SourceMaterial PDFs are present.
- Inspected existing 01_Narration_And_Dialog subfolders to align new content structure with current organization.

## Plan
1. Flesh out 01_Narration_And_Dialog/01_Mists_Arrival with deeply scripted, area-based narration and dialog from first contact with the mists through first Barovian locations.
2. Create base folder structure for:
   - 02_NPC_Dossiers/
   - 03_Monsters/
   - 04_Encounters/
   - 05_Lookup_Tables/
   - 06_Campaign_Trackers/
3. Populate initial, highly detailed markdown files for:
   - Early mists sequence narration (road, strange sounds, corpse with letter, gates of Barovia, first wilderness scenes).
   - Core recurring NPCs in the early chapters (e.g., Strahd, Ismark, Ireena, villagers, added background NPCs) with beliefs, motivations, knowledge matrices, and combat sheets.
   - Early random and set-piece encounters with exact layouts and monster lists.
   - Foundational lookup tables (atmospheric details, Barovian rumors, random Strahd sightings, environmental effects, travel complications).
   - Campaign trackers for time, weather, Strahd’s interest level, village states, and NPC relationship maps.
4. Cross-reference all content so a new DM can jump between narration, NPC dossiers, encounters, and trackers quickly.

## Next Actions
- Build detailed markdown structure and first wave of content for the mists-arrival-to-Barovia segment.
- Iterate with additional passes expanding depth and breadth until the campaign support material surpasses source volume by orders of magnitude.
