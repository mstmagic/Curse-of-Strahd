All work will written but the Writer, Reviewed by a Master Dungeon Master who will check for accuracy and story telling, A new dungeon master to check if the source material is easily navigated and easy to understand while providing alot of detail, A Player to ensure that it is fun to play, and a Editor and Publisher to make sure all the tasks were fullfilled. Thier notes will be tracked in seperate .md files md files in the Agents folder. Please read thier notes before begining.

I have uploaded the Curse of Strahd Dungeon's & Dragons campaign to Github in a folder called "SourceMaterial".

You should probably start by Transcribing the books.

I am a new Dungeon Master and I need to make notes, lots of them. All of them should be in MarkDown and sorted neatly. This repository should be massive, easily 100 times more than the source content as it elaborates on the source material and adds new material. 

01_Narration_And_Dialog/
02_NPC_Dossiers/
03_Monsters/
04_Encounters/
05_Lookup_Tables/
06_Campaign_TrackERS/

Starting from the point that the players get mysteriously whisked away by the mists, please create all the documentation that I will need. I want to remain true to the Lore and the Campaign and to D&D. However, I also want to put in a lot of new highly descriptive world building. I want this campaign to have a lot of role playing and a lot of narration. Please add a lot of additional narration that goes well beyond the book while it continues to follow the dark and depressing theme of the book. Add additional background characters and scenery. I would like you to lay out a lot of possible strahd encounters, both optional and required. I want to be able to introduce strahd in mini adventures. Sometimes they will be skiped but it will give me alot of opportunities to vilinise strahd depending on how fast the adventures move through the campaifn. Give a lot of opportunities for players to interact with the world. Give Reasonable responses to the most common actions. Please also create mini adventures that are marked that would allow me to re-track players In one folder I need a series of narration and dialog queues. BE DESCRIPTIVE AND ENCORAGE IMMAGINATION. I'm terrible at acting, so I need the notes to act as a step by step guide with narration and NPC dialog. They should be in folder tree sorted by area. Each sub folder will reference smaller and smaller area's within the larger area. These will be pinned to the map so as the players reach that point, I will open the appropriate note and start reciting. It should also start with a small sentence about how that character should be voiced and acted. It should contain any actions I need to perform or any action that I would prompt the players with. It should allow for player interections and provide options of how to respond. This would include encounters, player checks, switching maps, and more. I would like to make sure there is ALOT of opportunities to engage the players. Either directly "What do you do" or silence to allow them to choose thier next path. Please fill out the world with many additional characters so the players have an entire world to interact with and not just a story book. All of this will be contained in the first folder in chronoligal order and by area.

In another folder I will need a list of NPC's and any information I might need to know about them. This includes graphic detail about the NPCs attributes, demographics, identifying information, personality, beliefs, primary and secondary motivations. I will also need a full list of everything the character knows, doesn't know, is willing to share, is unwilling to share, willing or unwilling to do. This list need to be comprehensive and should include everything, everywhere, and everyone that the in the book. Please mention or create any player checks that might need to be made to convince or force the NPC. It should also include a character sheet incase the character enter's battle.

In another folder, I need a list of Monsters with full character sheets. In another folder, I need a list of encounters. Each encounter should lay out the battle exactly! List of Monsters, and where those monsters are.

I need lookup tables for everything!

I also need a list of things to track in the campaign.

Don't be afraid to add cross references, but always point to the refence so I can quickly pull it up. The cross references should be in the place where the reference was made.

Some work has already started, please track your progress in an agents\Agent.md file on the root.

- Each file includes explicit cross-references to the planned folders: ../../02_NPC_Dossiers, ../../03_Monsters, ../../04_Encounters, ../../06_Campaign_TrackERS (note: capitalization in cross-references matches original prompt; repository contains 06_Campaign_Trackers — ensure canonical link when using).
