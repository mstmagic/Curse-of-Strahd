# Master DM Notes

*(Existing guidance retained; appended new work log entry.)*

## Recent Additions – Mists & Entry Focus

- Ensured that new narration reinforces **Barovia as a prison** from the first steps after the mist transition.
- Added an early optional **Strahd rider cameo** and an **audio-only laugh encounter**, designed to be skippable without damaging plot structure.
- Emphasized cross-references so DMs can jump quickly between narration, encounters, lookups, and trackers, especially for the arrival segment.

### Structural Concerns
- Need to expand additional regions beyond the mists in the same structured way to avoid over-investing only in the opening sequence.
- Strahd dossier is now strong for early characterization; later we should create **scene-specific Strahd behaviors** for Vallaki, Old Bonegrinder, and Castle Ravenloft.
