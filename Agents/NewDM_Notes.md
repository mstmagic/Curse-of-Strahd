# New DM Notes

## Session Focus
- Starting at: Characters drawn into Barovia by the mists (see SourceMaterial/Curse of Strahd Book.pdf, Chapter 2: The Lands of Barovia, "Into the Mists").
- Goal: Build extensive, hand-holding narration and dialog so a nervous or inexperienced DM can simply read and follow prompts.

## Structure I Will Build
- 01_Narration_And_Dialog/
  - Organized by region → sub‑region → specific scene, from entering the mists through early Barovia travel, Village of Barovia, and initial Strahd teases.
  - Each scene will include:
    - "How to voice/act" guidance
    - Boxed read‑aloud narration
    - Suggested beats to pause and ask "What do you do?"
    - Common player actions and suggested responses / checks
    - Hooks for roleplay with extra background NPCs
    - Optional and required Strahd sightings / mini‑encounters.
- 02_NPC_Dossiers/
  - Full writeups for every canon NPC in these early chapters, plus new Barovian NPCs (inn guests, street vendors, priests, Vistani, etc.).
  - Each entry: appearance, mannerisms, beliefs, secrets, knowledge, what they will/won’t do or say, and combat stat block pointer.
- 03_Monsters/
  - Fully written 5e‑style stat blocks for creatures encountered from the mists through early Barovia travel and Village of Barovia (wolves, dire wolves, Strahd zombies, swarms, etc.), plus a few custom monsters supporting the new scenes.
- 04_Encounters/
  - Highly scripted encounters mapping to the narration scenes.
  - Each encounter: setup, terrain, enemy placement, tactics, morale, escalation if Strahd intervenes.
- 05_Lookup_Tables/
  - Tables for weather, atmospheric events, wandering NPCs, random Strahd signs, Barovian rumors, road events, etc., tuned to these early areas.
- 06_Campaign_Trackers/
  - Track Strahd’s interest, Barovian fear level, NPC relationship notes, and timeline of events.

## Tone and Themes
- Stay lore‑true to Curse of Strahd.
- Emphasize bleak, oppressive horror; rare but meaningful moments of fragile hope.
- Heavy focus on roleplay and slow, descriptive narration.
- Provide many small, optional scenes to flex pacing: can be skipped, compressed, or expanded.

## Next Steps
- Read all existing Agent notes and keep them updated as new structures and patterns emerge.
- Begin by scaffolding the area/scene folder structure under 01_Narration_And_Dialog from the first moment the mists appear through arrival in the Village of Barovia.
- In parallel, start a minimal but expandable index file in each major folder to keep navigation easy for a stressed new DM.
