# New DM Notes

## Using the New Mists & Entry Materials

- Start with `01_Narration_And_Dialog/01_Mists_And_Entry/02_First_Steps_Into_Barovia.md` when your players first arrive in the mists.
- Use the **bold prompts** like "What do you do?" exactly as written if you are nervous about improv; they are designed to naturally hand control back to the players.
- When players investigate, pull details from `05_Lookup_Tables/Mists_Arrival_Lookups.md` so you always have something creepy and specific to say.
- Log what happens in `06_Campaign_Trackers/01_Mists_And_Entry_Tracker.md` so you can **call back** to their early choices later (Strahd loves to reference their first mistakes).
- Remember: you do **not** have to use every optional Strahd mini-encounter. Pick one or two that feel right for the pacing of your table.
