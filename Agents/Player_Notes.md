# Player-Focused Fun & Experience Notes

*(Existing content preserved; new reflections appended.)*

## Early Experience – The Mists

- The opening in the mists is now built to give players **clear choices**: test the boundary, explore the forest, follow or ignore signs of other travelers.
- Optional Strahd scenes (rider, disembodied laugh) are intended to make him feel **ever-present** without forcing early combat.
- Random roadside oddities provide constant small hooks for curious players to interact with—picking things up, investigating graves, etc.—even when combat is not happening.
- The tracker encourages the DM to remember **what scared which player**, so later scenes can echo those beats and feel personal.
