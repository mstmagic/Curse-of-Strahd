# 03_Monsters

Comprehensive bestiary for Curse of Strahd, focused on:
- Full, ready-to-use stat blocks for all monsters appearing in the campaign.
- Barovia-specific variants (reskinned or modified from official 5e SRD creatures).
- Tactics, lair behavior, and environmental synergies.
- Descriptive, horror-focused narration hooks for each creature.

Each monster entry will include:
- **Quick-Use Summary**: Threat level, environment, and purpose in story.
- **Stat Block**: 5e-compatible, rules-accurate.
- **Tactics & Behavior**: Before combat, during combat, and in retreat/aftermath.
- **Roleplaying & Description**: How to describe the monster with dread and sensory richness.
- **Hooks & Uses**: Extra scenes or mini-adventures where this monster can appear.

Entries will be cross-referenced with:
- `04_Encounters/` for specific battle maps and scripts.
- `01_Narration_And_Dialog/` for read-aloud cues.
- `05_Lookup_Tables/` for random encounter integration.
