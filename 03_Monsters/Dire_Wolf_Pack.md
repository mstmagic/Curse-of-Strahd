# Dire Wolf Pack

## Stat Outline (per wolf)
- **Medium beast, unaligned**
- **AC:** 14 (natural armor) | **HP:** 37 (5d8+15) | **Speed:** 50 ft
- **STR 17 DEX 15 CON 15 INT 3 WIS 12 CHA 7**
- **Skills:** Perception +3, Stealth +4
- **Senses:** Passive Perception 13 | **Keen Hearing and Smell**
- **Pack Tactics:** Advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one ally is within 5 ft.
- **Bite:** +5 to hit, reach 5 ft, 2d6+3 piercing; DC 13 Strength save or prone.

## Tactics
- Harry the weakest or isolated target, aiming to knock prone then pile on.
- Howl round 1 to unsettle (flavor) and signal for reinforcements.
- Retreat if two wolves drop or if radiant damage appears.

## Motivations
- Serve Strahd as hunters and watchers; defend chosen hunting grounds.
- Driven by hunger and command—will test PCs but flee if clearly outmatched.

## Terrain and Environment
- Favor dense fog or pine thickets. Gain half-cover when darting between trees.
- At night, eyes glint red; footsteps muffled on mossy ground.

## Alternate Difficulty
- **Easier:** Remove Pack Tactics or reduce HP to 24.
- **Harder:** Add a scarred alpha with +2 HP per level, AC 15, and a bonus action menacing growl (DC 12 Wis or frightened for 1 round).

## Encounter Hooks
- **Road Ambush:** Hidden along ditches (see 04_Encounters/01_Road_Ambush.md).
- **Graveyard Stirring:** Feast on corpses, reacting violently to intruders.

## Outcomes
- **Success:** PCs earn raven approval, may find black feather token that wards against fear once (advantage on next save).
- **Failure:** PCs knocked prone and mauled; Strahd may appear overhead as a bat to observe.
